### Set a custom user agent

You can change the user agent at the page level by passing `userAgent` as a top-level parameter in the JSON body. This is useful if the target website serves different content based on the user agent.

:::note
The `userAgent` parameter does not bypass bot protection. Requests from Browser Rendering will always be identified as a bot.
