### Improve blurry screenshot resolution

If you set a large viewport width and height, your screenshot may appear blurry or pixelated. This can happen if your browser's default `deviceScaleFactor` (which defaults to 1) is not high enough for the viewport.

To fix this, increase the value of the `deviceScaleFactor`.
```json
{
  "url": "https://cloudflare.com/",
  "viewport": {
    "width": 3600,
    "height": 2400,
    "deviceScaleFactor": 2
  }
}
```
