We have implemented `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt` and also created per-page Markdown links as follows:

- [`llms.txt`](/llms.txt)
- [`llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt)
  - We also provide a `llms-full.txt` file on a per-product basis, i.e [`/workers/llms-full.txt`](/workers/llms-full.txt)
- [`/$page/index.md`](index.md)
  - Add `/index.md` to the end of any page to get the Markdown version, i.e [`/style-guide/index.md`](/style-guide/index.md)
- [`/markdown.zip`](/markdown.zip)
  - An export of all of our documentation in the aforementioned `index.md` format.

In the top right of this page, you will see a `Page options` button where you can copy the current page as Markdown that can be given to your LLM of choice.
