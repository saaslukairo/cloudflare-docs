Cloudflare can [automatically scan for common records](/dns/zone-setups/reference/dns-quick-scan/) and add them to the [DNS zone](/dns/concepts/#zone) for you, or you can add records manually. These records show up under your domain on the [**DNS Records**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page of the dashboard.
