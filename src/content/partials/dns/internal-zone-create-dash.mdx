1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Internal DNS** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/internal-dns" />

2. Select **Create an internal zone**.
3. Give your internal zone a name.

{ props.conditional === "get-started-detail" && (

<Details header="Internal zone configuration conditions">
	<Render file="internal-zones-conditions" product="dns" />
</Details>
) }

4. Add DNS records to your internal zone using your preferred option:

- [Import](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/) a formatted BIND file.
- Select **Add a record** and choose **Create** under the record type you want to add. Refer to [DNS record types](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/) for details.

5. Repeat this process for each internal zone you wish to add.
