Queues are included in the monthly subscription cost of your Workers Paid plan, and charges based on operations against your queues. Refer to [Pricing](/queues/platform/pricing/) for more details.

Before you can use Queues, you must enable it via [the Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/queues). You need a Workers Paid plan to enable Queues.

To enable Queues:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Queues** page.

	 <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers/queues" />

2. Select **Enable Queues**.
