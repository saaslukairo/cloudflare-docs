[Event subscriptions](/queues/event-subscriptions/) allow you to receive messages when events occur across your Cloudflare account. Cloudflare products (e.g., [KV](/kv/), [Workers AI](/workers-ai/), [Workers](/workers/)) can publish structured events to a [queue](/queues/), which you can then consume with Workers or [HTTP pull consumers](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) to build custom workflows, integrations, or logic.

For more information on [Event Subscriptions](/queues/event-subscriptions/), refer to the [management guide](/queues/event-subscriptions/manage-event-subscriptions/).
