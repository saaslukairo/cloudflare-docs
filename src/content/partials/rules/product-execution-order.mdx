The execution order of Rules features is the following:

- [Single Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/)
- [URL Rewrite Rules](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/)
- [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/)
- [Origin Rules](/rules/origin-rules/)
- [Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/)
- [Managed Transforms](/rules/transform/managed-transforms/)
- [Request Header Transform Rules](/rules/transform/request-header-modification/)
- [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/)
- [Snippets](/rules/snippets/)
- [Cloud Connector](/rules/cloud-connector/)

The different types of rules listed above will take precedence over [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/). This means that Page Rules will be overridden if there is a match for both Page Rules and the Rules products listed above.
