To access audit logs in the Cloudflare dashboard:

In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Audit Logs** page.

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/audit-log" />

You can search these audit logs by user email or domain and filter by date range. To download audit logs, click **Download CSV**.

:::note


Depending on the volume of data, the export of large amounts of events from Audit Logs might fail with errors. We always recommend using Cloudflare [Logpush](/logs/logpush/) to make sure Audit Logs are always available and stored externally.
