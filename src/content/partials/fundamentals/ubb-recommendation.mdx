import { DashButton } from "~/components";

Since this is a service with [usage-based billing](/billing/usage-based-billing/), Cloudflare recommends that you set up usage-based billing notifications to avoid unexpected bills.

To set up those notifications:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Notifications** page.

      <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/notifications" />

2. On **Alert Type** of **Usage Based Billing**, click **Select**.

3. Fill out the following information:

   * **Name**
   * **Product**
   * **Notification limit** (exact metric will vary based on product)
   * **Notification email**

   :::note
   Some plans also have access to alerts through [PagerDuty](/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/) and [Webhooks](/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/).
   :::

4. Select **Save**.
