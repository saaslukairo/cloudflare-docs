:::note
The global rate limit for the Cloudflare API is 1,200 requests per five minute period per user, and applies cumulatively regardless of whether the request is made via the dashboard, API key, or API token.

If you exceed this limit, all API calls for the next five minutes will be blocked, receiving a `HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests` response.
:::

Some specific API calls have their own limits and are documented separately, such as the following:

- [Cache Purge APIs](/cache/how-to/purge-cache/#availability-and-limits)
- [GraphQL APIs](/analytics/graphql-api/limits/)
- [Rulesets APIs](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/#limits)
- [Lists API](/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/#rate-limiting-for-lists-api-requests)
- [Gateway Lists API](/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/lists/#api-rate-limit)

Enterprise customers can also [contact Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to raise the Client API per user, GraphQL, or API token limits to a higher value.
