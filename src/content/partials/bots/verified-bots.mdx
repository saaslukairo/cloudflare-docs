Cloudflare maintains an internal directory of [verified bot](/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/) and [signed agents](/bots/concepts/bot/signed-agents/) that are associated with search engine optimization (SEO), website monitoring, and more.

You can use this directory to prevent any bot protection measures from impacting otherwise helpful bots and agents, such as search crawlers.

For a partial list of verified bots and signed agents, refer to [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/verified-bots).
