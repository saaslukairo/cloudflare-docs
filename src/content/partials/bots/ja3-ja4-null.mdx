The JA3 or JA4 fingerprint is an SSL/TLS-based identifier and can be null or empty in logs under specific circumstances:

- Since JA3 and JA4 are calculated during the TLS (SSL) handshake, they will not be present for non-encrypted HTTP traffic.
- The field may be empty when a [Worker](/workers/) sends a request to a zone that is either internal to Cloudflare's network (Orange-to-Orange traffic that is not proxied) or to a third-party origin, or when a Worker is routing traffic to the target zone.
- The fingerprints may be absent when Bot Management itself is skipped for a request, as the feature is responsible for calculating and populating these values.

Generally, [Orange to Orange (O2O) traffic](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/) should include JA3 or JA4 fingerprints unless a Worker is used to route traffic from the eyeball (client-facing) zone to the target zone.
