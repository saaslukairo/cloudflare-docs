By default, all DNS requests on the user device are resolved by Cloudflare's [public DNS resolver](/1.1.1.1/) except for common top level domains used for local resolution (such as `localhost`). To allow users to connect to internal server names or domains that do not resolve on the public Internet, you have two options:

- [Add internal domains to Local Domain Fallback](#local-domain-fallback)
- [Build custom resolver policies](#resolver-policies)

## Local Domain Fallback

Local Domain Fallback tells the WARP client to send specific DNS requests to your private DNS resolver instead of to Cloudflare's public DNS resolver. This method was the primary delivery mechanism for private DNS for a long time, and is the simplest option, but it has two shortcomings: you cannot deterministically route private DNS queries to different resolvers based on specific attributes, and you cannot apply Gateway DNS policies to this traffic because Cloudflare is not resolving it.

To learn more about how Local Domain Fallback works, refer to [How the WARP client handles DNS requests](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/#how-the-warp-client-handles-dns-requests).
