1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), select **Zero Trust**.

   <DashButton url="https://one.dash.cloudflare.com" />

2. On the onboarding screen, choose a <GlossaryTooltip term="team name">team name</GlossaryTooltip>. The team name is a unique, internal identifier for your Zero Trust organization. Users will enter this team name when they enroll their device manually, and it will be the subdomain for your App Launcher (as relevant). Your business name is the typical entry.

3. Complete your onboarding by selecting a subscription plan and entering your payment details. If you chose the **Zero Trust Free plan**, this step is still needed but you will not be charged.
