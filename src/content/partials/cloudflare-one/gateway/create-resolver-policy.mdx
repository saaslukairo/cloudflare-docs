:::caution[Virtual network limitation]
Resolver policies do not automatically update when you change the virtual networks associated with a route. If you move a route from one virtual network to another, the resolver policy will still reference the old virtual network. You will need to manually remove and recreate the resolver policy to update the route.
:::

To create a resolver policy:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Traffic policies** > **Resolver policies**.
2. Select **Add a policy**.
3. Create an expression for your desired traffic. For example, you can resolve a hostname for an internal service:

   | Selector | Operator | Value                  |
   | -------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
   | Host     | in       | `internal.example.com` |

   Make sure your destination is not subject to [Local Domain Fallback](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/#manage-local-domains).

4. In **Select DNS resolver**, choose _Configure custom DNS resolvers_.
5. Enter the IP addresses of your custom DNS resolver. As you enter an IP address, Gateway will search through your [virtual networks](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/) configured in Zero Trust.
6. In **Network**, choose whether to route queries publicly (to the Internet) or privately (to a private network service).
7. (Optional) Enter a custom port for each IP address.
8. Select **Create policy**.

Custom resolvers are saved to your account for future use. You can add up to 10 IPv4 and 10 IPv6 addresses to a policy.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):

   - `Zero Trust Write`

2. Create a resolver policy using the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_gateway_policy) resource:

   ```tf
   resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_policy" "resolver_policy" {
   	name        = "Example resolver policy"
   	enabled     = true
   	account_id  = var.cloudflare_account_id
   	description = "TERRAFORM MANAGED resolver policy"
   	action      = "resolve"
   	traffic     = "dns.fqdn in {\"internal.example.com\"}"
   	identity    = "identity.email in {\"jdoe@example.com\"}"
   	precedence  = 1
   	rule_settings = {
   			dns_resolvers = {
   			# You can add up to 10 IPv4 and 10 IPv6 addresses to a policy.
   				ipv4 = [{
   					ip = "192.0.2.24"
   					port = 53
   					route_through_private_network = true
   					vnet_id = cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_virtual_network.staging_vnet.id
   				}]
   				ipv6 = [{
   					ip = "2001:DB8::"
   					port = 53
   					route_through_private_network = true
   					vnet_id = cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_virtual_network.staging_vnet.id
   				}]
   			}
   	}
   }
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When a user's query matches a resolver policy, Gateway will send the query to your listed resolvers in the following order:

1. Public resolvers
2. Private resolvers behind the default virtual network for your account
3. Private resolvers behind a custom virtual network

Gateway will cache the fastest resolver for use in subsequent queries. Resolver priority is cached on a per user basis for each data center.
