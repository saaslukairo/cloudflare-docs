import { Render, Tabs, TabItem, APIRequest } from "~/components";

To create a new network policy:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Traffic policies** > **Firewall policies**.
2. In the **Network** tab, select **Add a network policy**.
3. Name the policy.
4. Under **Traffic**, build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to allow or block.
5. Choose an **Action** to take when traffic matches the logical expression. For example, you can use a list of [device serial numbers](/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/warp-client-checks/corp-device/) to ensure users can only access an application if they connect with the WARP client from a company device:

   <Render
   	file="gateway/policies/enforce-device-posture"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />

6. Select **Create policy**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="API">

1. [Create an API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

   | Type    | Item       | Permission |
   | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
   | Account | Zero Trust | Edit       |

2. (Optional) Configure your API environment variables to include your [account ID](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and API token.
3. Send a `POST` request to the [Create a Zero Trust Gateway rule](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/rules/methods/create/) endpoint. For example, you can use a list of [device serial numbers](/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/warp-client-checks/corp-device/) to ensure users can only access an application if they connect with the WARP client from a company device:

   <APIRequest
   	path="/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/rules"
   	method="POST"
   	json={{
   		name: "Enforce device posture",
   		description:
   			"Ensure only devices in Zero Trust organization can connect to application",
   		precedence: 0,
   		enabled: true,
   		action: "block",
   		filters: ["l4"],
   		traffic: 'any(net.sni.domains[*] == "internalapp.com")',
   		identity: "",
   		device_posture:
   			'not(any(device_posture.checks.passed[*] in {"LIST_UUID"}))',
   	}}
   />

```sh output
{
	 "success": true,
	 "errors": [],
	 "messages": []
}
```

The API will respond with a summary of the policy and the result of your request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>
