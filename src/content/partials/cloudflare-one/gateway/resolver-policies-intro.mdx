[Resolver policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/) provide similar functionality to Local Domain Fallback but occur in Cloudflare Gateway rather than on the local device. This option is recommended if you want more granular control over private DNS resolution. For example, you can ensure that all users in a specific geography use the private DNS server closest to them, ensure that specific conditions are met before resolving private DNS traffic, and apply [Gateway DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/dns-policies/) to private DNS traffic.
