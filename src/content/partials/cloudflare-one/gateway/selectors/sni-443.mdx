By default, SNI selectors only apply to HTTPS traffic on port `443`. To inspect traffic on every port, turn on [protocol detection](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/protocol-detection/) and choose to [inspect on all ports](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/protocol-detection/#inspect-on-all-ports).
