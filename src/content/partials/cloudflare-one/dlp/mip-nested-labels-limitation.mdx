:::caution
DLP does not filter or log [MIP sublabels](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/sensitivity-labels#sublabels-that-use-parent-labels-or-label-groups). Only top-level sensitivity labels will be detected, filtered, and logged.

To ensure DLP will detect and filter all sensitive data, use only [MIP top-level labels](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/sensitivity-labels#top-level-labels).
