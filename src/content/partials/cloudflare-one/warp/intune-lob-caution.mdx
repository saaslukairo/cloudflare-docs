:::caution
Do not deploy WARP via [Intune's line-of-business (LOB) deployment method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/apps/lob-apps-macos). This deployment type is not supported. Use [Intune's `.pkg` deployment method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/apps/macos-unmanaged-pkg) instead to successfully install the WARP client on macOS.
