The WARP client consists of:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Control panel that allows end users to view WARP's [status](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/troubleshooting/connectivity-status/) and perform actions such as turning WARP on or off.
- **WARP daemon (or service)**: Core background component responsible for establishing secure tunnels (using WireGuard or MASQUE) and handling all WARP functionality on your device.

Refer to [WARP architecture](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/warp-architecture/) for more information on how the WARP client interacts with a device's operating system to route traffic.
