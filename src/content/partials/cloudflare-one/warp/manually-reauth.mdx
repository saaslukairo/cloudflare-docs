To manually refresh your Cloudflare Access session and update your group information from your identity provider (IdP), go to the following URL in your browser and fill in your [team name](/cloudflare-one/faq/getting-started-faq/#what-is-a-team-domainteam-name):

`https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/refresh-identity`

Reauthenticating resets your [session duration](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/) and fetches the latest group information from the organization's IdP.
