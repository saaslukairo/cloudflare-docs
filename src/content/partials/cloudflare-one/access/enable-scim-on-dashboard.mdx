1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Integrations** > **Identity providers**.

2. Find the {props.idp} integration and select **Edit**.

3. Turn on **Enable SCIM** {props.supportgroups && <span> and <strong>{props.supportgroups}</strong>.</span>}

4. (Optional) Configure the following settings:

* **Enable user deprovisioning**: [Revoke a user's active session](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/#per-user) when they are removed from the SCIM application in {props.idp}. This will invalidate all active Access sessions and prompt for reauthentication for any [WARP session policies](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-sessions/).
* **Remove user seat on deprovision**: [Remove a user's seat](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/users/seat-management/) from your Cloudflare One account when they are removed from the SCIM application in {props.idp}.
* **SCIM identity update behavior**: Choose what happens in Cloudflare One when the user's identity updates in {props.idp}.
	- _Automatic identity updates_: Automatically update the [User Registry identity](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/users/users/) when {props.idp} sends an updated identity or group membership through SCIM. This identity is used for Gateway policies and WARP [device profiles](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/); Access will read the user's updated identity when they reauthenticate.
	- _Group membership change reauthentication_: [Revoke a user's active session](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/#per-user) when their group membership changes in {props.idp}. This will invalidate all active Access sessions and prompt for reauthentication for any [WARP session policies](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-sessions/). Access will read the user's updated group membership when they reauthenticate.
	- _No action_: Update the user's identity the next time they reauthenticate to Access or WARP.

5. Select **Regenerate Secret**. Copy the **SCIM Endpoint** and **SCIM Secret**. You will need to enter these values into {props.idp}.

6. Select **Save**.

The SCIM secret never expires, but you can manually regenerate the secret at any time.
