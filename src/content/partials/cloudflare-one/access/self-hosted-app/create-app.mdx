1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access controls** > **Applications**.

2. Select **Add an application**.

3. Select **Self-hosted**.

4. Enter any name for the application.

5. In **Session Duration**, choose how often the user's [application token](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/application-token/) should expire.

   Cloudflare checks every HTTP request to your application for a valid application token. If the user's application token (and global token) has expired, they will be prompted to reauthenticate with the IdP. For more information, refer to [Session management](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/).
