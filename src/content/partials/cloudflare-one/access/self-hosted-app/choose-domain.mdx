In the **Domain** dropdown, select the domain that will represent the application. Domains must belong to an active zone in your Cloudflare account. You can use [wildcards](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/app-paths/) to protect multiple parts of an application that share a root path.

    	Alternatively, to use a [Cloudflare for SaaS custom hostname](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/secure-with-access/), set **Input method** to _Custom_ and enter your custom hostname.
