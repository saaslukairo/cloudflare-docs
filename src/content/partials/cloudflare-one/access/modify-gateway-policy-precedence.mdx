By default, Cloudflare will evaluate Access application policies after evaluating all Gateway network policies. To evaluate Access applications before or after specific Gateway policies:

<ol>
<li>
Create the following [Gateway network policy](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/network-policies/):

	| Selector                     | Operator | Value     | Action |
	| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
	| {props.selector}             | is       | _Present_ | Allow  |
</li>

{ props.protocol === "rdp" && (<> <li> Ensure that <strong>Enforce WARP client session duration</strong> is turned off, otherwise users will be blocked from accessing RDP targets. </li> </>)}

<li>
Update the policy's [order of precedence](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/order-of-enforcement/#order-of-precedence) using the dashboard or API.
</li>

</ol>

{ props.selector === "Access Infrastructure Target" &&	(<p> This Gateway policy will apply to all Access for Infrastructure targets, including RDP and SSH. </p>) }

:::note
Users must pass the policies in your Access application before they are granted access. The Gateway Allow policy is strictly for routing and connectivity purposes.
