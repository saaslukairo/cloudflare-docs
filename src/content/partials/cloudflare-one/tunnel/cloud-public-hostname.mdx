[Published applications](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/) allow anyone on the Internet to connect to HTTP resources hosted on your virtual private cloud (VPC). To add a published application for your Cloudflare Tunnel:

1. In the **Published application routes** tab, enter a hostname for the application (for example, `hellocloudflare.<your-domain>.com`).
2. Under **Service**, enter `http://localhost:80`.
3. Select **Save**.
4. To test, open a browser and go to `http://hellocloudflare.<your-domain>.com`. You should see the **Hello Cloudflare!** test page.

You can optionally [create an Access application](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/) to control who can access the service.
