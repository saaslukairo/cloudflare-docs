To forward DNS traffic from the subnet to Cloudflare Gateway, your router should point DNS queries to the shared IP addresses for the Gateway DNS resolver:

- `172.64.36.1`
- `172.64.36.2`

You will also need to [add an IP route](#add-ip-route-to-router) which routes these Gateway resolver IPs to the WARP Connector host machine.
