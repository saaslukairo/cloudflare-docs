To start logging and filtering network traffic, turn on the Gateway proxy:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Go to **Traffic policies** > **Traffic settings**.
2. In **Proxy and inspection**, turn on **Allow Secure Web Gateway to proxy traffic**.
3. Select **TCP**.
4. (Recommended) To proxy traffic to internal DNS resolvers, select **UDP**.
5. (Recommended) To proxy traffic for diagnostic tools such as `ping` and `traceroute`, select **ICMP**. You may also need to [update your system](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/proxy/#icmp) to allow ICMP traffic through `cloudflared`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Zero Trust Write`

2. Turn on the TCP and/or UDP proxy using the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_device_settings`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_device_settings) resource:

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_settings "global_warp_settings" {
		account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id
	  gateway_proxy_enabled = true
		gateway_udp_proxy_enabled = true
	}
	```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Cloudflare will now proxy traffic from enrolled devices, except for the traffic excluded in your [split tunnel settings](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/#3-route-private-network-ips-through-warp). For more information on how Gateway forwards traffic, refer to [Gateway proxy](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/proxy/).
