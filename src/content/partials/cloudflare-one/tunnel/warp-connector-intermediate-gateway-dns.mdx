To filter DNS traffic with Cloudflare Gateway, the DNS resolver on your device should point to the shared IP addresses for the Gateway DNS resolver IPs:

- `172.64.36.1`
- `172.64.36.2`

You will also need to [add an IP route](#add-ip-route-to-devices) which routes these Gateway resolver IPs to the WARP Connector host machine.
