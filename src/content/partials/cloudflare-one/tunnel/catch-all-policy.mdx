To prevent WARP users from accessing your entire private network, we recommend creating a [catch-all Gateway block policy](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/build-policies/create-policy/#catch-all-policy) for your private IP space. You can then layer on higher priority Allow policies (in either Access or Gateway) which grant users access to specific applications or IPs.
