| **Healthy**   | The tunnel is active and serving traffic through four connections to the Cloudflare global network.                                    | No action is required. Your tunnel is running correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Inactive**  | The tunnel has been created (via the API or dashboard) but the `cloudflared` connector has never been run to establish a connection.                          | Run the tunnel as a service (recommended) or use the `cloudflared tunnel run` command on your origin server to connect the tunnel to Cloudflare. Refer to [substep 6 of step 1 in the Create a Tunnel dashboard guide](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#1-create-a-tunnel) or step 4 in the [Create a Tunnel API guide](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#1-create-a-tunnel).                           |
| **Down**      | The tunnel was previously connected but is currently disconnected because the `cloudflared` process has stopped.                                            | 1. Ensure the `cloudflared` [service](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/as-a-service/) or process is actively running on your server. <br /> 2. Check for server-side issues, such as the machine being powered off, an application crash, or recent network changes.                                                                                                |
| **Degraded**  | The `cloudflared` connector is running and the tunnel is serving traffic, but at least one individual connection has failed. Further degradation in [tunnel availability](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/configure-tunnels/tunnel-availability/) could risk the tunnel going down and failing to serve traffic.               | 1. Review your `cloudflared` [logs](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/monitor-tunnels/logs/) for connection failures or error messages. <br /> 2. Investigate local network and firewall rules to ensure they are not blocking connections to the [Cloudflare Tunnel IPs and ports](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/configure-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/). <br />                                                                        |
