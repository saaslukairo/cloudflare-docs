To connect your devices to Cloudflare:

1. [Deploy the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/) on your devices in Gateway with WARP mode or [generate a proxy endpoint](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/agentless/pac-files/) and deploy a PAC file.
2. [Create device enrollment rules](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/) to determine which devices can enroll to your Zero Trust organization.
