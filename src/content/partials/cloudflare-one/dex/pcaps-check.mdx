To view a list of captures, go to **DEX** > **Remote captures**. The **Status** column displays one of the following options:

- **Success**: The capture is complete and ready for download. Any partially successful captures will still upload to Cloudflare. For example, there could be a scenario where the PCAP succeeds on the primary network interface but fails on the WARP tunnel interface. You can [review PCAP results](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/#download-remote-captures) to determine which PCAPs succeeded or failed.
- **Running**: The capture is in progress on the device.
- **Pending Upload**: The capture is complete but not yet ready for download.
- **Failed**: The capture has either timed out or encountered an error. To retry the capture, check the WARP client version and [connectivity status](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/#fleet-status), then start a [new capture](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/#start-a-remote-capture).
