The WARP diagnostics analyzer highlights what Cloudflare determines to be the most important detection events in a `warp-diag` log. You can use the detection report to help parse your [log files](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/troubleshooting/warp-logs/#warp-diag-logs) and identify the root cause of client issues. The WARP diagnostic analyzer is only available for logs [collected via the dashboard](#collect-logs-via-the-dashboard).

To access the WARP diagnostic analyzer:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Remote captures**.
2. Locate an existing `warp-diag` log from the list or select **Run diagnostics** to generate a new `warp-diag` log.
3. Select the three dots for the `warp-diag` log that you want to analyze, then select **View WARP Diag**.

	The **Overview** tab will display an [AI-generated summary](/fundamentals/reference/cloudy-ai-agent/) of the results, a list of detection events, and basic device information.
