### `getAlarm`

- <code>getAlarm(options <Type text="Object" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />)</code>: <Type text="Promise<Number | null>" />
  - Retrieves the current alarm time (if set) as integer milliseconds since epoch. The alarm is considered to be set if it has not started, or if it has failed and any retry has not begun. If no alarm is set, `getAlarm()` returns `null`.

#### Supported options

- Same options as [`get()`](#get), but without `noCache`.

### `setAlarm`

- <code>setAlarm(scheduledTime <Type text="Date | number" />, options <Type text="Object" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />)</code>: <Type text="Promise" />
  - Sets the current alarm time, accepting either a JavaScript `Date`, or integer milliseconds since epoch.

  If `setAlarm()` is called with a time equal to or before `Date.now()`, the alarm will be scheduled for asynchronous execution in the immediate future. If the alarm handler is currently executing in this case, it will not be canceled. Alarms can be set to millisecond granularity and will usually execute within a few milliseconds after the set time, but can be delayed by up to a minute due to maintenance or failures while failover takes place.

### `deleteAlarm`

- <code>deleteAlarm(options <Type text="Object" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />)</code>: <Type text="Promise" />
  - Deletes the alarm if one exists. Does not cancel the alarm handler if it is currently executing.

#### Supported options

- `setAlarm()` and `deleteAlarm()` support the same options as [`put()`](#put), but without `noCache`.
