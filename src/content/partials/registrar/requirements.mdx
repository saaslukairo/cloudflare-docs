## Requirements

All domains using Cloudflare Registrar must use Cloudflare for authoritative DNS on a [full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/)[^1]. This means [onboarding your domain](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) by [updating your nameservers](/dns/nameservers/update-nameservers/) to your assigned Cloudflare nameservers. You cannot change to another DNS provider's nameservers while using Cloudflare Registrar.

[^1]: Meaning Cloudflare is your primary, authoritative DNS provider.
