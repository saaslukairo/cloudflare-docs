<Steps>
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Client Certificates** page.

    <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/client-certificates" />
2. Select **Create a mTLS rule**.
3. In **Custom rules**, several rule parameters have already been filled in. Enter the URI path you want to protect in **Value**.
4. (Optional) Add a `Hostname` field and enter the mTLS-enabled hostnames you wish to protect in **Value**.
5. In **Choose action**, select `Block`.
6. Select **Deploy** to make the rule active.
</Steps>

Once you have deployed your mTLS rule, any requests without a [valid client certificate](/ssl/client-certificates/) will be blocked.
