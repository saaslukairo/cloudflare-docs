		text={`
		Before you can install ${props.productNameVirtual}, you need an Enterprise account with Magic WAN. Additionally, you need to have a VMware or Proxmox host with sufficient compute, memory, and storage to run the virtual machine with ${props.productNameVirtual}. This includes:
    - Intel x86 CPU architecture
    - ESXi hypervisor 7.0U1 or higher
    - 4 virtual CPUs per virtual connector (We recommend deployment with a 1:1 virtual CPU to physical core allocation to avoid CPU over contention which will cause packet loss.)
    - 8 GB of RAM per virtual connector
    - 8 GB of disk per virtual connector
    - One vSwitch port group or VLAN with access to the Internet (for example, through a WAN)
    - One or more vSwitch port group or VLAN that will be the internal LAN

    If you are installing ${props.productNameVirtual} on ESXi, refer to [VMware's documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.install.doc/GUID-B2F01BF5-078A-4C7E-B505-5DFFED0B8C38.html) for more information on how to install ESXi and configure a virtual machine.

		If you are installing ${props.productNameVirtual} on Virtual Environment, refer to [Proxmox documentation](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/get-started) for more information on how to install Virtual environment and configure a virtual machine.

## Before you begin

There are a couple of decisions you need to make when installing your { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName }. Refer to the topics below for more information.

### Determine the need for a high availability configuration

You can install up to two instances of { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } for redundancy at each of your sites. If one of your devices fails, traffic will fail over to the other, ensuring that you never lose connectivity to that site.

In this type of high availability (HA) configuration, you will choose a reliable LAN interface as the HA link which will be used to monitor the health of the peer connector. HA links can be dedicated links or can be shared with other LAN traffic.

You must decide the type of configuration you want for your site from the beginning: no redundancy or with redundancy. You cannot add redundancy after finishing the configuration of your dashboard settings. If, at a later stage, you decide to enable redundancy, you will need to delete your { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } device in the Cloudflare dashboard, and start again.

<Card title="Do you need a high availability configuration?" icon="information">

- If you need a high availability configuration for your premises, refer to
  [About high availability configurations](#about-high-availability-configurations) for more information
  and learn how to configure your { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } device in this mode.

- If you do not need a high availability configuration for you premises, check if you need a [DHCP or a static IP setup](#decide-on-dhcp-vs-static-ip-connections) before proceeding to [Set up Cloudflare dashboard](#set-up-cloudflare-dashboard).

</Card>

:::caution
You cannot enable high availability for an existing { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } on-ramp. To add high availability to an existing { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } on-ramp in the Cloudflare dashboard, you need to delete the on-ramp and start again. Plan accordingly to create a high availability configuration from the start if needed.
:::


### Decide on DHCP vs static IP connections

{ props.magicWord === "hardware" && (
  <>
    <p>You can use {props.productName} in both DHCP networks and networks that require a static IP configuration. At first boot, however, {props.productName} needs to reach out to Cloudflare to download your settings and go through the activation process. If any of the networks plugged into your {props.productName} device are DHCP enabled, do not use a VLAN, and have an Internet connection, that process is handled automatically. However, if all of the networks require more information to utilize, (such as a network with static IPs, or tagged VLAN networks) your {props.productName} might need some more information to proceed.</p>

		<p>There are couple of ways to provide this information. Choose the one that fits your workflow: </p>

		**2. Deploy the ${props.productNameVirtual} on VMware**

		The following instructions assume you already have VMware ESXi hypervisor installed with sufficient resources. Refer to [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for more information.

		1. When setting up your VMware ESXi, you need to create port groups for ${props.productNameVirtual}. Go to **Networking** > **Port groups**, and prepare your vSwitch port groups and/or VLANs for your desired network topology. For example, a simple deployment typically has:
			- A WAN port group where the ${props.productNameVirtual} will get an IP address (static or DHCP) that has access to the Internet.
			- A LAN port group, where the ${props.productNameVirtual} will act as default router, and possibly DHCP server.
			- A null, or unused, port group for allocating unused virtual interfaces in the ${props.productNameVirtual}. You can, for example, create a null port group with the name of <code>Null port group</code>, and a **VLAN ID** of <code>999</code>.

## About high availability configurations

{props.hardSoftConn} When you set up a site in high availability, the WANs and LANs in your { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } have the same configuration but are replicated on two nodes. In case of failure of one of the devices, the other device becomes the active node, taking over the configuration of the LAN gateway IP and allowing traffic to continue without disruption.

Because { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName }s in high availability configurations share a single site, you need to set up:

- **Static address**: The IP for the primary node in your site.
- **Secondary static address**: The IP for the secondary node in your site.
- **Virtual static address**: The IP that the LAN south of the { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } device will forward traffic to, which is the LAN's gateway IP.

Make sure all IPs are part of the same subnet.

For detailed information about the expected behavior of high availability configurations, refer to the <a href={props.hcConfigsURL}>High availability configurations</a> reference page.

### Create a high availability configuration

You cannot enable high availability for an existing site. To add high availability to an existing site in the Cloudflare dashboard, you need to delete the site and start again.

To set up a high availability configuration:

<Markdown
text={`
1. Follow the steps in ${props.dashName === "WAN Tunnels" ? "[Create a new profile](#create-a-new-profile)" : "[Add a Connector on-ramp](#add-a-connector-on-ramp)"} up until step 4.
`}
inline={false}
/>
2. After naming your site, select **Turn on high availability**.
3. Select **Create and continue**.
4. Select **Add {props.deviceTypeName}**.
5. From the list, choose your first { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } > **Add {props.deviceTypeName}**.
6. Back on the previous screen, select **Add secondary {props.deviceTypeName}**.
7. From the list, choose your second { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } > **Add {props.deviceTypeName}**.
8. Select **Continue** to create a WAN. If you are configuring a static IP, configure the IP for the primary node as the static address, and the IP for the secondary node as the secondary static address.
9. To create a LAN, follow the steps mentioned above in [Create a LAN](#create-a-lan) up until step 4.
10. In **Static address**, enter the IP for the primary node in your site. For example, `192.168.10.1/24`.
11. In **Secondary static address**, enter the IP for the secondary node in your site. For example, `192.168.10.2/24`.
12. In **Virtual static address**, enter the IP that the LAN south of the { props.magicWord === "virtual" ? props.productNameVirtual : props.productName } device will forward traffic to. For example, `192.168.10.3/24`.
13. Select **Save**.
14. From the **High availability probing link** drop-down menu, select the port that should be used to monitor the node's health. Cloudflare recommends you choose a reliable interface as the HA probing link. The primary and secondary node's probing link should be connected over a switch, and cannot be a direct connection.
15. {props.magicWord === "hardware" && (<>Follow the instructions in <a href="#set-up-your-magic-wan-connector">Set up your Magic WAN Connector</a> and <a href="#activate-appliance">Activate appliance</a> to finish setting up your Connectors.</>)} {props.magicWord === "virtual" && (<>Follow the instructions in <a href="#activate-appliance">Activate appliance</a> to finish setting up your Connectors.</>)}
