{props.hardwareProductName} is a lightweight appliance you can install in corporate network locations to automatically connect, <GlossaryTooltip term="traffic steering">steer</GlossaryTooltip>, and shape any IP traffic through <a href={props.ipsecRefUrl}>secure IPsec tunnels</a>. {props.hardwareProductName} is the easiest way to onboard your network locations to Cloudflare One. It is managed remotely through the Cloudflare dashboard, so you do not require an onsite IT team.

You can <a href={props.hardwareUrl}>purchase {props.hardwareProductName}</a> software pre-installed on a Cloudflare-certified device, or download and deploy <a href={props.virtualUrl}>{props.virtualProductName}</a> in your own infrastructure.

Either option ensures the best possible connectivity to the closest Cloudflare network location, where Cloudflare will apply security controls and send traffic on an optimized route to its destination.

{props.hardwareProductName} has the same type of support process as other Cloudflare Enterprise products. Contact your team account manager to learn more.
