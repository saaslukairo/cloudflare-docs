3. In **Interrupt window**, select the most appropriate time for the Magic WAN Connector to update its systems:
   - **Timezone**: Select the time zone for the Magic WAN Connector to update.
   - **Start time**: Choose an hour for the Magic WAN Connector to start updating. Cloudflare recommends you choose an hour when there is minimal activity in your network, to avoid potential disruptions.
   - **Duration**: Duration indicates the time window during which the Magic WAN Connector is scheduled to update. For example, if you configure your Magic WAN Connector to update at `22:00` and specify a **Duration** of `4 hours`, the Magic WAN Connector will attempt to update within the four-hour period following `22:00`.
