## Add an application to your account

Before you can add or remove {props.featureName} applications to your Magic WAN Connector, you need to create an account-level list with the applications that you want to configure. Currently, adding to or modifying this list is only possible via API, through the [`managed_app_id`](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/create/) endpoint.

To add applications to your account:

Send a `POST` request to add new apps to your account.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/apps"
	method="POST"
	json={{
    "managed_app_id": "<APP_ID>",
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",
    "type": "<APP_TYPE>",
	}}
	/>

	```json output
	{
		"result": {
			"account_app_id": "eb09v665c0784618a3e4ba9809258fd4",
			"name": "<APP_NAME>",
			"type": "<APP_TYPE>",
		},
		"success": true,
		"errors": [],
		"messages": []
	}
	```

You can now add this new app to the {props.featureName} list in your Magic WAN Connector.

### Add an application to Magic WAN Connector

You need to configure {props.featureName} applications for each of your existing sites, as this is a per-site configuration.

You can pin applications to a specific WAN port in Magic WAN Connector when you need control over which WAN port your applications egress from the device. In case your preferred WAN port goes down, Magic WAN Connector automatically fails over to a standard configured WAN port priority.

With this preferred breakout port, customers have direct control over their local Internet breakout traffic. You can designate a specific WAN uplink as the primary path for your critical applications configured to bypass the Cloudflare network. This provides the predictability and control needed for performance-sensitive applications, ensuring your critical traffic always takes the path you choose.
