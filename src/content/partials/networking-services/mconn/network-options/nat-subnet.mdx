Each subnet (directly-attached or routed) must have a unique address space within your Magic WAN. You can re-use address spaces locally by enabling static network address translation (NAT) for a subnet. NAT is static. This means that inbound connections - from Magic WAN to the site behind the Connector - are allowed, and connections do not have to be initiated by hosts behind the Magic WAN Connector. NAT is also 1:1, that is, the  Connector will translate between corresponding addresses in two equal-sized prefixes.

To enable NAT, supply a WAN-facing address prefix the same size as the subnet's prefix, and the Magic WAN Connector will translate between the two.

For example:

- **Prefix**: `192.168.100.0/24`
- **Static NAT prefix**: `10.10.100.0/24`

With the example above, outbound traffic from host `192.168.100.13` in the subnet is translated to `10.10.100.13` in the Magic WAN Connector (and vice versa for incoming traffic).

:::note
Even if NAT is enabled, the local prefix for a subnet must be unique within its LAN. It can, however, be reused on other LANs or other sites. Overlay-facing prefixes - that is, a subnet's NAT prefix if NAT is enabled, and its local prefix otherwise - must always be unique across your whole Magic WAN.
