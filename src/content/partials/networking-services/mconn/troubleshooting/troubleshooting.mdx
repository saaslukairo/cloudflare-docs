- Kernel boot time (how long it has been running and if it is activated or not)
- Last device snapshot (this also shows the frequency with which your device captures the snapshots that are used in several troubleshooting procedures)
- CPU temperature
- CPU load over time
- Used RAM over time

To access performance analytics:

<Render file="mconn/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-steps"	product="networking-services" params={{ dashName: props.dashName }} />
4. Select **Performance analytics**.

### Port analytics

## Troubleshooting tips

If you are experiencing difficulties with your Magic WAN Connector, refer to the following tips to troubleshoot what might be happening.

## I have set up a site, but my Magic WAN Connector is not working

Make sure that you have <a href={props.activateURL}>activated your Magic WAN Connector</a>. Cloudflare ships the Magic WAN Connector deactivated, and the it will only establish a connection to the Cloudflare network when it is activated.

## I have tried to activate Magic WAN Connector, but it is still not working

Check if your Magic WAN Connector is connected to the Internet via a port that can serve DHCP. This is required the first time a Magic WAN Connector boots up so that it can reach the Cloudflare global network and download the required configurations that you set up in the Site configuration step. Refer to <a href={props.activateURL}>Activate Connector</a> for more details.

If you have a firewall deployed upstream of the Magic WAN Connector, <a href={props.firewallURL}>check your firewall settings</a>. You might need to configure your firewall to allow traffic in specific ports for the Magic WAN Connector to work properly.

## I can access Magic WAN Connector's health checks, but there is no traffic

If you have a firewall deployed upstream of the Magic WAN Connector, make sure you review your <a href={props.firewallURL}>firewall settings</a>. You might need to configure your firewall to allow traffic in specific ports for the Magic WAN Connector to work properly.

## Devices I have behind Magic WAN Connector cannot connect to the Internet

If you have other routing appliances behind Magic WAN Connector, make sure you create policy-based routing policies to send traffic from your devices through Magic WAN Connector, instead of these other routing devices.

## How do I know if my device is contacting Cloudflare?

Magic WAN Connector sends a heartbeat periodically to Cloudflare. You can <a href={props.heartbeatURL}>access the dashboard</a>, and check for the heartbeat status of your Connector device.

## What do I do in the event of hardware issues with Magic WAN Connector?

Cloudflare is the single point of contact for any issues related to Magic WAN Connector, including issues with hardware. When required, Cloudflare Support will work with our partner, TD Synnex, to resolve any issues with the physical device.
