  Conditional rendering based on showSiteId prop:
  - When showSiteId=true (NetFlow page): "To export NetFlow statistics, you will need your [account ID] and [API token], as well as the `site_id` associated with your Magic WAN Connector."
  - When showSiteId=false/undefined (other pages): "You will need your [account ID] and [API token] to use the API."
  The ternaries only render the differing prefix and suffix to avoid content duplication.
