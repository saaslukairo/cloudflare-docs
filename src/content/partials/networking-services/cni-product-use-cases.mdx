CNI provides a private point-to-point IP connection with Cloudflare. There are two dataplanes that come with different technical specifications.


|  | Dataplane v1 | Dataplane v2 (beta) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Magic Transit Direct Server Return (DSR)** <br /> DDoS protection for all ingress traffic from the Internet to your public network. Send egress traffic via your ISP. | Supported with or without a GRE tunnel established over the interconnect circuit. | Supported. |
| **Magic Transit with Egress** <br /> DDoS protection for all ingress traffic from the Internet to your public network. Send egress traffic via Cloudflare. | Supported with or without a GRE tunnel established over the interconnect circuit. | Supported. |
| **Magic WAN and Zero Trust**  <br /> Build a secure, private network backbone connecting your Zero Trust users and applications with all your sites, data centers, and clouds. | Supported with or without a GRE tunnel established over the interconnect circuit. | Supported. |
| **Peering** <br /> Exchange public routes with a single Cloudflare PoP (Point of Presence). | Supported. <br /><br /> All customers connecting with the edge data center will exchange public routes at that PoP with AS13335. Connectivity is established at each individual PoP. Routes for other edge locations in Cloudflare's network may not be available. Routes for customer-advertised prefixes will be available only in the connected PoP. | Not supported. |
| **Application Security and Performance** <br /> Improve the performance and security of your web applications | **Supported via peering**: Customers can use Argo Smart Routing to direct origin traffic via the edge peering connection when it is determined to be the lowest latency option. Customers must maintain a direct Internet connection which will always be used for a portion of traffic and during failure scenarios. <br /> **Supported Via Magic Transit**: Customers may configure any product with an origin server IP address that is protected by Magic Transit. Magic Transit will direct this traffic via the overlay and customer can control interconnect next-hops using the Magic networking routing table. | When the origin IPs are behind Magic Transit over a CNI v2, all Cloudflare services that work with public origins (like Load Balancer, WAF, Cache) will run over the CNI. |
