{props.productName} customers that send sFlow data to Cloudflare can receive alerts when a specific type of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is detected within their network traffic. {props.productName} uses the same DDoS attack detection rules that protect Cloudflare's global network to generate these alerts for customers.

Only customers that send sFlow data to Cloudflare can configure a sFlow DDoS attack rule.

An sFlow DDoS attack rule can only be configured via Cloudflare's API. Today, customers are unable to configure a sFlow DDoS attack rule in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Send sFlow data from your network to Cloudflare

Customers can export sFlow data of their network traffic to Cloudflare via {props.productName}. There are <a href={props.supportedRoutersURL}>specific brands and models</a> of routers that are capable of generating sFlow data. Make sure to check the router specifications to ensure that it is able to export sFlow data. Customers can follow this <a href={props.sflowConfigURL}>sFlow configuration guide</a> to configure sFlow exports to {props.productName}.
