{props.productName} includes an onboarding workflow that guides you step-by-step through the product configuration process. If you are unable to complete the configuration in one session, you can exit the workflow and resume it at any time.

To begin using {props.productName} for network and/or cloud traffic visibility, complete the list of tasks below.

## NetFlow and sFlow guide

### 1. Verify NetFlow or sFlow capabilities

Verify your routers are capable of exporting <GlossaryTooltip term="NetFlow">NetFlow</GlossaryTooltip> or <GlossaryTooltip term="sFlow">sFlow</GlossaryTooltip> to an IP address on Cloudflare's network. {props.productName} supports NetFlow v5, NetFlow v9, IPFIX, and sFlow.

Refer to <a href={props.supportedRoutersURL}>Supported routers</a> to view a list of supported routers. The list is not exhaustive.

### 2. Register your router with Cloudflare

When you register your router with Cloudflare, your router links your NetFlow or sFlow data to your Cloudflare account.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Magic Monitoring** page.

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/network-monitoring" />

2. In **Magic Network Monitoring Analytics**, select **Configure Magic Network Monitoring**.
3. Select the **Configure routers** tab.
4. (Optional) Under **IP Address**, enter your router's public IP address.
5. Under **Default router sampling rate**, enter a value for the <GlossaryTooltip term="sampling">sampling</GlossaryTooltip> rate. The value should match the sampling rate of your NetFlow or sFlow configuration.
6. Select **Next**.

### 3. Configure your router

Next, configure your router to send NetFlow/SFlow data to Cloudflare. For this step, you will also need to have your router's configuration menu open to input the values shown in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Refer to the [NetFlow/IPFIX configuration](/magic-network-monitoring/routers/netflow-ipfix-config/) or the [sFlow configuration guide](/magic-network-monitoring/routers/sflow-config/) for more information.

1. From **Configure routers** in the dashboard, select either **NetFlow Configuration** or **sFlow configuration**.
2. Follow the configuration steps for the selected configuration type.
3. Enter the values shown in your router's configuration.
4. Select **Next**.

### 4. Check your router configuration

After setting up your router, confirm the configuration was successfully set up.

From the **Check routers** page on the dashboard, you can view the status of your routers. Keep in mind that router data takes five to ten minutes to be sent to Cloudflare.

Refer to **Router status description** to confirm whether data is successfully being sent.

When you are done with router configuration, select **Finish onboarding**.

:::note
This will only be visible during the onboarding process. When you are finished onboarding, this page will no longer be visible.

### 5. Create rules

Create rules to analyze data for a specific set of destinations or to implement thresholds. Refer to <a href={props.rulesURL}>Rules</a> for more information.

## VPC flow log guide <Badge text="Beta" variant="caution" />

### 1. Verify cloud flow log capabilities

Verify that your AWS account is capable of exporting AWS VPC flow logs via AWS Firehose. Currently, {props.productName} only supports VPC flow log ingestion for AWS.

### 2. Set up AWS Firehose to export VPC flow logs to Cloudflare

:::note
AWS VPC flow logs can only be configured via the Cloudflare API for {props.productName}. There are no inputs in the dashboard for configuring AWS VPC flow logs.
:::

1. Create an authorization token via [Cloudflare's API for {props.productName}](/api/resources/magic_network_monitoring/subresources/vpc_flows/subresources/tokens/methods/create/). This authorization token allows Cloudflare to identify and verify the account sending VPC flow logs to our endpoint.

	<APIRequest
		path="/accounts/{account_id}/mnm/vpc-flows/token"
		method="POST"
	/>

2. Set the `HTTP Headers - X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` in the stream configuration for the authorization token generated in the previous step.

3. Send your AWS Firehose VPC flow log stream towards `https://aws-flow-logs.cloudflare.com/`.

4. Select all of the AWS VPC flow log data fields that you want to send to Cloudflare. You should select the highest number AWS VPC flow log version that supports all the fields you want to export to Cloudflare (refer to [AWS flow log documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html) for more information). For example, if you need a version 8 field like `reject-reason`, you must export all fields from versions 1 through 8. Cloudflare supports all seven templates for AWS VPC Flow logs.

### 3. Verify your cloud traffic via analytics

After setting up AWS Firehose to send VPC flow logs to {props.productName}, you can confirm that Cloudflare is receiving the logs as expected by searching for your cloud traffic data in the analytics page of the {props.productName} dashboard.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Magic Monitoring** page.

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/network-monitoring" />

The default view will be the analytics dashboard for Magic Network Monitoring.
