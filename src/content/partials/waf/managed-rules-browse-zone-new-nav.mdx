1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security rules** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules" />

2. (Optional) Filter by **Managed rules**.

3. Search for the managed ruleset you want to configure/browse. Look for a rule with an _Execute_ action.

4. Select the rule name (containing the name of the managed ruleset), and then select **Browse rules**.
