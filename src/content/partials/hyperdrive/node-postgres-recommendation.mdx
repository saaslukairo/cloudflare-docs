:::note[Recommended driver]

[Node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) (`pg`) is the recommended driver for connecting to your Postgres database from JavaScript or TypeScript Workers. It has the best compatibility with Hyperdrive's caching and is commonly available with popular ORM libraries. [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) is also supported.
