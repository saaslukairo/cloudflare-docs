To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

- The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
- The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
- The password associated with that username.
- The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/):
<Steps>
1. Open your terminal and run the following command. Replace `<NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG>` with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

	```sh
	npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
	```

2. This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

	<WranglerConfig>

	```toml
	name = "hyperdrive-example"
	main = "src/index.ts"
	compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
	compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

	# Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
	[[hyperdrive]]
	binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
	id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
	```

	</WranglerConfig>
</Steps>

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.
