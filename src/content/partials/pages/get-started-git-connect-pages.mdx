Pages offers support for [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/). To create your first Pages project:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages" />
2. Select **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.

You will be prompted to sign in with your preferred Git provider. This allows Cloudflare Pages to deploy your projects, and update your PRs with [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/).

:::note


Signing in with GitLab will grant Pages access to all repositories on your account. Additionally, if you are a part of a multi-user Cloudflare account, and you sign in with GitLab, other members will also have the ability to deploy your repositories to Pages.

If you are using GitLab, you must have the **Maintainer** role or higher on the repository to successfully deploy with Cloudflare Pages.
