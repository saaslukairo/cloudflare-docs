If your own Cloudflare zone is on the Enterprise plan, you have access to the [zone hold feature](/fundamentals/account/account-security/zone-holds/), which is a toggle that prevents your domain name from being created as a zone in a different Cloudflare account. Additionally, if the zone hold is enabled, it prevents the activation of custom hostnames onboarded to {props.providerName}. {props.providerName} would receive the following error message for your custom hostname: `The hostname is associated with a held zone. Please contact the owner of this domain to have the hold removed.`

To successfully activate the custom hostname on {props.providerName}, the owner of the zone needs to [temporarily release the hold](/fundamentals/account/account-security/zone-holds/#release-zone-holds). If you are only onboarding a subdomain as a custom hostname to {props.providerName}, only the subfeature titled **Also prevent Subdomains** needs to be temporarily disabled.

Once the zone hold is temporarily disabled, follow {props.providerName}'s instructions to refresh the custom hostname and it should activate.
