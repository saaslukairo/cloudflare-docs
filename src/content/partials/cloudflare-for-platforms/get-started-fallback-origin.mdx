The fallback origin is where Cloudflare will route traffic sent to your custom hostnames (must be proxied).

:::note

To route custom hostnames to distinct origins, refer to [custom origin server](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/custom-origin/).

:::

To create your fallback origin:

1. [Create](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) a proxied `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` record pointing to the IP address of your fallback origin (where Cloudflare will send custom hostname traffic).

<Example>

| **Type** | **Name**         | **IPv4 address** | **Proxy status** |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `A`      | `proxy-fallback` | `192.0.2.1`      | Proxied          |

</Example>

2. Designate that record as your fallback origin.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Custom Hostnames** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/custom-hostnames" />

2. For **Fallback Origin**, enter the hostname for your fallback origin.
3. Select **Add Fallback Origin**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Using the hostname of the record you just created, [update the fallback origin value](/api/resources/custom_hostnames/subresources/fallback_origin/methods/update/).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

3. Once you have added the fallback origin, confirm that its status is **Active**.

:::note
When Cloudflare marks your fallback origin as **Active**, that only reflects that we are ready to send traffic to that DNS record.

You need to make sure your DNS record is sending traffic to the correct origin location.
