import { DashButton } from "~/components";

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Custom Hostnames** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/custom-hostnames" />

2. Select a hostname.
3. Copy the values for **Certificate validation TXT name** and **Certificate validation TXT value**.

If you had previously created a **wildcard** custom hostname, you would need to copy the values for two different validation TXT records.
