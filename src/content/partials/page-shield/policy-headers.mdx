When you create policies, Cloudflare will generate content security policy (CSP) directives from those policies based on their configuration:

- Log policies will create CSP directives for the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` HTTP header.
- Allow policies will create CSP directives for the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header.
