You must have Docker running locally when you run `wrangler deploy`. For most people, the best way to install Docker is to follow the [docs for installing Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Other tools like [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) may also work.

You can check that Docker is running properly by running the `docker info` command in your terminal. If Docker is running, the command will succeed. If Docker is not running,
the `docker info` command will hang or return an error including the message "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon".
