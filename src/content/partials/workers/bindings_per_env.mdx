## Local development

**Local simulations**: During local development, your Worker code always executes locally and bindings connect to locally simulated resources [by default](/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings). This is supported in [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/).

**Remote binding connections:**: Allows you to connect to remote resources on a [per-binding basis](/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings). This is supported in [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/).

## Remote development

During remote development, all of your Worker code is uploaded and executed on Cloudflare's infrastructure, and bindings always connect to remote resources. **We recommend using local development with remote binding connections instead** for faster iteration and debugging.

Supported only in [`wrangler dev --remote`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) - there is **no Vite plugin equivalent**.
