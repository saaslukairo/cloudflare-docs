:::caution
Do not use `vars` to store sensitive information in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file. Use secrets instead.
:::

Put secrets for use in local development in either a `.dev.vars` file or a `.env` file, in the same directory as the Wrangler configuration file.

:::info
Choose to use either `.dev.vars` or `.env` but not both. If you define a `.dev.vars` file, then values in `.env` files will not be included in the `env` object during local development.
:::

These files should be formatted using the [dotenv](https://hexdocs.pm/dotenvy/dotenv-file-format.html) syntax. For example:

```bash title=".dev.vars / .env"
SECRET_KEY="value"
API_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9"
```

:::caution[Do not commit secrets to git]
The `.dev.vars` and `.env` files should not committed to git. Add `.dev.vars*` and `.env*` to your project's `.gitignore` file.
:::

To set different secrets for each Cloudflare environment, create files named `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` or `.env.<environment-name>`.

When you select a Cloudflare environment in your local development, the corresponding environment-specific file will be loaded ahead of the generic `.dev.vars` (or `.env`) file.

- When using `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` files, all secrets must be defined per environment. If `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` exists then only this will be loaded; the `.dev.vars` file will not be loaded.
- In contrast, all matching `.env` files are loaded and the values are merged. For each variable, the value from the most specific file is used, with the following precedence:
  - `.env.<environment-name>.local` (most specific)
  - `.env.local`
  - `.env.<environment-name>`
  - `.env` (least specific)

:::note[Controlling `.env` handling]
It is possible to control how `.env` files are loaded in local development by setting environment variables on the process running the tools.

- To disable loading local dev vars from `.env` files without providing a `.dev.vars` file, set the `CLOUDFLARE_LOAD_DEV_VARS_FROM_DOT_ENV` environment variable to `"false"`.
- To include every environment variable defined in your system's process environment as a local development variable, ensure there is no `.dev.vars` and then set the `CLOUDFLARE_INCLUDE_PROCESS_ENV` environment variable to `"true"`.
