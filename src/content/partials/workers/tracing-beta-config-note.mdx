:::note
In the future, Cloudflare plans to enable automatic tracing in addition to logs
when you set `observability.enabled = true` in your Wrangler configuration.

While automatic tracing is in early beta, this setting will not enable tracing by default,
and will only enable logs.

An updated [`compatibility_date`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) will be required for this change to take effect.
