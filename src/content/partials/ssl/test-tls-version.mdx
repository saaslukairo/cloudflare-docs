To test supported TLS versions, attempt a request to your website or application while specifying a TLS version.

For example, to test TLS 1.1, use the `curl` command below. Replace `www.example.com` with your Cloudflare domain and hostname.

```sh
curl https://www.example.com -svo /dev/null --tls-max 1.1
```

If the TLS version you are testing is blocked by Cloudflare, the TLS handshake is not completed and returns an error:

`* error:1400442E:SSL routines:CONNECT_CR_SRVR_HELLO:tlsv1 alert`

:::note
Local VPN or a device security client may prevent insecure connections using legacy protocols like TLS 1.0. Make sure to disable such network or security client before running the test on your device.
