1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates" />

2. Select a certificate.
3. Copy the values for **Certificate validation TXT name** and **Certificate validation TXT value**.

If you had created a **wildcard** certificate, you would need to copy the values for two different validation TXT records.
