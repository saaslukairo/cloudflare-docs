To check whether your certificates have been validated and reissued:

* **Dashboard**: Find the certificate(s) on the [**Edge Certificates**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates) page and make sure that the **Status** is **Active**.
* **API**: Send a [`GET`](/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate_packs/methods/list/) request and confirm that your certificate(s) have `"status": "active"`.
