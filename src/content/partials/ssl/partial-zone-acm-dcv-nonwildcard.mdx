If every hostname on a non-wildcard certificate is <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status" link="/dns/proxy-status/">proxying traffic</GlossaryTooltip> through Cloudflare and the DCV method is [HTTP](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/http/), Cloudflare can automatically complete DCV on your behalf.

This applies to customers using [Universal](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) or [Advanced certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/).

If one of the hostnames on the certificate is not proxying traffic through Cloudflare, certificate issuance and renewal will vary based on the type of certificate you are using:

* **Universal**: Perform DCV using one of the available [methods](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/).
* **Advanced**: In most cases, you can opt for [Delegated DCV](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/), which greatly simplifies certificate management.


:::tip
If all hostnames are proxied and non-wildcard but you are using [TXT](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/txt/) as DCV method for advanced certificates, also consider [Delegated DCV](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/) to simplify the process.
