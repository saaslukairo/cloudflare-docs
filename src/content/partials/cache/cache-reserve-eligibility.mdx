Not all assets are eligible for Cache Reserve. To be admitted into Cache Reserve, assets must:

- Be cacheable, according to Cloudflare's standard [cacheability factors](/cache/).
- Have a freshness time-to-live (TTL) of at least 10 hours (set by any means such as Cache-Control / [CDN-Cache-Control](/cache/concepts/cache-control/) origin response headers, [Edge Cache TTL](/cache/how-to/edge-browser-cache-ttl/#edge-cache-ttl), [Cache TTL By Status](/cache/how-to/configure-cache-status-code/), or [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/)),
- Have a Content-Length response header.
- When using [Image transformations](/images/manage-images/create-variants/), original files are eligible for Cache Reserve, but resized file variants are not eligible because transformations happen after Cache Reserve in the response flow.
