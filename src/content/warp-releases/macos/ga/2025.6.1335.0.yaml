releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains minor fixes and improvements.


  **Changes and improvements**

  - Fixed an issue preventing devices from reaching split-tunneled traffic even when WARP was disconnected.

  - Fix to prevent WARP from re-enabling its firewall rules after a user-initiated disconnect.

  - Improvement for faster client connectivity on high-latency captive portal networks.

  - Fixed an issue where recursive CNAME records could cause intermittent WARP connectivity issues.


  **Known issues**

  - macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.4 or later.

  - Devices using WARP client 2025.4.929.0 and up may experience Local Domain Fallback failures if a fallback server has not been configured. To configure a fallback server, refer to [Route traffic to fallback server](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/#route-traffic-to-fallback-server).
