releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains significant improvements to our captive portal / public
  Wi-Fi detection logic. If you have experienced captive portal issues in the past, re-test and give this version a try.


  **Changes and improvements**

  - Improved [captive portal detection](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/captive-portals/) to make more public networks compatible
  and have faster detection.

  - Improved error messages shown in the app.

  - WARP tunnel protocol details can now be viewed using the `warp-cli tunnel stats`
  command.

  - Fixed issue with device revocation and re-registration when switching
  configurations.



  **Known issues**

  - macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP
  client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.3
  or later.
