releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains minor fixes and improvements including enhancements to [Proxy mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/#proxy-mode) for even faster resolution. The MASQUE protocol is now the only protocol that can use Proxy mode. If you previously configured a device profile to use Proxy mode with Wireguard, you will need to select a new [WARP mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/) or all devices matching the profile will lose connectivity.

  **Changes and improvements**
  - Enhancements to [Proxy mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/#proxy-mode) for even faster resolution. The MASQUE protocol is now the only protocol that can use Proxy mode. If you previously configured a device profile to use Proxy mode with Wireguard, you will need to select a new [WARP mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/) or all devices matching the profile will lose connectivity.
  - Fixed a bug preventing the `warp-diag captive-portal` command from running successfully due to the client not parsing SSID on macOS.
  - Improvements to maintain Global WARP Override settings when switching between organization configurations.
  - The [MASQUE protocol](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#device-tunnel-protocol) is now the default protocol for all new WARP device profiles.
  - Improvement to limit idle connections in DoH mode to avoid unnecessary resource usage that can lead to DoH requests not resolving.

  **Known issues**
  - macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.4 or later.
  - Devices using WARP client 2025.4.929.0 and up may experience Local Domain Fallback failures if a fallback server has not been configured. To configure a fallback server, refer to [Route traffic to fallback server](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/#route-traffic-to-fallback-server).
