releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains minor fixes and improvements.

  **Changes and improvements**
  - Fixed an issue preventing devices from reaching split-tunneled traffic even when WARP was disconnected.
  - Fix to prevent WARP from re-enabling its firewall rules after a user-initiated disconnect.
  - Improvement to managed network detection checks for faster switching between managed networks.

  **Known issues**
  - Devices using WARP client 2025.4.929.0 and up may experience Local Domain Fallback failures if a fallback server has not been configured. To configure a fallback server, refer to [Route traffic to fallback server](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/#route-traffic-to-fallback-server).
