releaseNotes: |-
  **Changes and improvements**
  - Fixed an issue where managed network policies could incorrectly report network location beacons as missing.
  - Improved DEX test error reporting.
  - Fixed an issue causing client notifications to fail in IPv6 only environments which prevented the client from receiving configuration changes to settings like device profile.
  - Added a TCP fallback for the MASQUE tunnel protocol to improve compatibility with networks on MASQUE.
  - Added new IP addresses for [tunnel connectivity checks](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#connectivity-checks). If your organization uses a firewall or other policies you will need to exempt these IPs.
  - Fixed an issue where frequent network changes could cause WARP to become unresponsive.
  - DNS over HTTPS traffic is now included in the WARP tunnel by default.
