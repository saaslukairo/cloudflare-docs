releaseNotes: |-
  **Changes and improvements**
  This release contains improvements and new exciting features, including post-quantum cryptography. By tunnelling your corporate network traffic over Cloudflare, you can now gain the immediate protection of post-quantum cryptography without needing to upgrade any of your individual corporate applications or systems.

  - Fixed a device registration issue causing WARP connection failures when changing networks.
  - Captive portal improvements including showing connectivity status in the client and sending system notifications for captive portal sign in
  - The WARP client now applies post-quantum cryptography end-to-end on enabled devices accessing resources behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. This feature can be enabled by MDM.
  - Improvement to gracefully handle changes made by MDM while WARP is not running.
  - Fixed an issue affecting split tunnel include mode, where traffic outside the tunnel was blocked when switching between Wifi and ethernet networks.
