The application security dashboard is your starting point to better understand the security posture of your web applications, and to configure rules to protect them.

<Card title="New dashboard experience" icon="rocket">

Cloudflare is gradually making the new **Security** dashboard available by default to users. Users who do not have the new dashboard by default can still manually opt in:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account and domain.
2. Open any page under **Security**.
3. In the top right-hand corner of the page, select **Try new dashboard**.

To opt out of the new security dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Security **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings" />

2. Turn off the setting **New application security dashboard**.

The opt-out option will be available for a limited time.
