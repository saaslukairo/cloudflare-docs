<Description>

Cloudflare's smart CAPTCHA alternative.

</Description>

Turnstile can be embedded into any website without sending traffic through Cloudflare and works without showing visitors a CAPTCHA.

## How Turnstile works

Turnstile adapts the challenge outcome to the individual visitor or browser. First, we run a series of small non-interactive JavaScript challenges to gather signals about the visitor or browser environment.

These challenges include proof-of-work, proof-of-space, probing for web APIs, and various other challenges for detecting browser-quirks and human behavior. As a result, we can fine-tune the difficulty of the challenge to the specific request and avoid showing a visual or interactive puzzle to a user.

### Widget types

Turnstile [widget types](/turnstile/concepts/widget/) include:

- **Non-interactive**: Visitors never need to interact with the widget.
- **Managed**: Visitors are presented with an interactive checkbox if they are a suspected bot.
- **Invisible**: The widget is completely hidden from the visitor.
