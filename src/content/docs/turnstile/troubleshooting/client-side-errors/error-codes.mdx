:::note

When an error code is marked with `***`, it means that the remaining numbers can be ignored and are for internal use.

## Error code `300***` and `600***`

Error code family `300***` and `600***` (e.g. "`600010: The generic_challenge_failure`") is a response generated by the Turnstile in situations where a potential bot or unusual visitor behavior is detected.

## Error code `401`

Turnstile may occasionally generate a `401` Unauthorized error in your browser console during a security check. This is not typically a problem with your implementation. This error often occurs when the widget attempts to request a [Private Access Token](/cloudflare-challenges/reference/private-access-tokens/) that your device or browser does not support yet. 

You can generally safely ignore the `401` error, as it is an expected part of Turnstile's underlying Challenge Platform workflow. If the widget is successfully resolving and you are receiving a token, no action is required.
