Offlabel is an Enterprise-only feature that removes Cloudflare branding and logo from Turnstile widgets. When enabled, widgets display without any visual references to Cloudflare, allowing for a seamless integration with your brand identity.

When Offlabel is enabled:

- The Cloudflare logo and color schemes are removed from all widget states.
- The widget maintains the same functionality, behavior, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance.
- All security features remain unchanged.

The widget will display with a clean, unbranded appearance that integrates seamlessly with your website's design.

## Implementation

### Enable Offlabel

After your account team enables the Offlabel entitlement, you can activate it for specific widgets using the Cloudflare API.

    ```bash title="cURL command" wrap
    curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/challenges/widgets/$WIDGET_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "offlabel": true
    }'
    ```

### Create new widgets with Offlabel

You can enable Offlabel when creating new widgets.

    ```bash title="cURL command" wrap
    curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/challenges/widgets" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "name": "Branded Widget",
        "domains": ["example.com"],
        "mode": "managed",
        "offlabel": true
    }'
    ```

### Verification

Confirm Offlabel is enabled by checking your widget configuration.

    ```bash title="cURL command" wrap
    curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/challenges/widgets/$WIDGET_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
    ```

The response will include `"offlabel": true` when the feature is active.
