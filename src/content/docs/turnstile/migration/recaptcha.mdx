If you are using reCAPTCHA today, you can switch seamlessly to Cloudflare Turnstile by following the step-by-step guide below to assist with the upgrade process.

To complete the migration, you must obtain the [sitekey and secret key](/turnstile/get-started/#get-a-sitekey-and-secret-key).

:::note

Turnstile migration is currently compatible up to reCAPTCHA v2.

## Client-side integration

<Steps>

  1. Update the client-side integration by inserting the Turnstile script snippet in your HTML's `<head>` element.

      ```html title="Turnstile script snippet"
      <script src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js?compat=recaptcha" async defer></script>
      ````

      :::note

      Adding `?compat=recaptcha` runs Turnstile in compatibility mode, which
      enables the following features:

      - implicit rendering for reCAPTCHA
      - `g-recaptcha-response` input name for forms
      - register the Turnstile API as `grecaptcha`
      :::

  2. Locate the `grecaptcha.render()` calls and replace the sitekey with your Turnstile sitekey.

      :::note

      Turnstile supports:

      - the `render()` call
      - reCAPTCHA v2 invisible mode with the `execute()` call
      :::
</Steps>

## Server-side integration

Update the server-side integration by replacing the Siteverify URL. 

Replace `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify` with the following:

```txt 
https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify
```

:::caution[Differences to reCAPTCHA's Siteverify]

reCAPTCHA supports `GET` requests using query parameters, such as `GET /siteverify?response=<response>&secret=<secret>`.

Turnstile's Siteverify endpoint does _not_ support this and only accepts `POST` requests with a FormData or JSON body.

Refer to [server-side validation](/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/) for more information.
