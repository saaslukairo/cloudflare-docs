This guide covers the steps you need to take to set up Security Center in your Cloudflare account for the first time.

## Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account
- At least one zone onboarded to Cloudflare

## Enable Security Insights and start initial scan

<Render file="setup" product="security-center" />

### Start a new scan

To manually start a scan:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Infrastructure** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/security-center/inventory" />

2. Select **Scan now**.

### Scan Frequency

Once you enable Security Insights, Cloudflare performs scans at a [regular frequency](/security-center/security-insights/how-it-works/#scan-frequency), according to your Cloudflare plan.
