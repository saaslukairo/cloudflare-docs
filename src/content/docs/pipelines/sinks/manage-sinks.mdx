Learn how to:

- Create and configure sinks for data storage
- View sink configuration
- Delete sinks when no longer needed

## Create a sink

Sinks are made available to pipelines as SQL tables using the sink name (e.g., `INSERT INTO my_sink SELECT * FROM my_stream`).

### Dashboard

<Steps>
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Pipelines** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/pipelines/overview" />
2. Select **Create Pipeline** to launch the pipeline creation wizard.
3. Complete the wizard to create your sink along with the associated stream and pipeline.
</Steps>

### Wrangler CLI

To create a sink, run the [`pipelines sinks create`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-sinks-create) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines sinks create <SINK_NAME> \
  --type r2 \
  --bucket my-bucket \
```

For sink-specific configuration options, refer to [Available sinks](/pipelines/sinks/available-sinks/).

Alternatively, to use the interactive setup wizard that helps you configure a stream, sink, and pipeline, run the [`pipelines setup`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-setup) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines setup
```

## View sink configuration

### Dashboard

<Steps>
	1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Pipelines** > **Sinks**.

    2. Select a sink to view its configuration.

</Steps>

### Wrangler CLI

To view a specific sink, run the [`pipelines sinks get`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-sinks-get) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines sinks get <SINK_ID>
```

To list all sinks in your account, run the [`pipelines sinks list`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-sinks-list) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines sinks list
```

## Delete a sink

### Dashboard

<Steps>
	1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Pipelines** > **Sinks**.

    2. Select the sink you want to delete.

    3. In the **Settings** tab, navigate to **General**, and select **Delete**.

</Steps>

### Wrangler CLI

To delete a sink, run the [`pipelines sinks delete`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-sinks-delete) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines sinks delete <SINK_ID>
```

:::caution
Deleting a sink stops all data writes to that destination.

## Limitations

Sinks cannot be modified after creation. To change sink configuration, you must delete and recreate the sink.
