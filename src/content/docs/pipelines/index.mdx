:::note
Pipelines is in **open beta**, and any developer with a [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/) can start using it. Currently, outside of standard R2 storage and operations, you will not be billed for your use of Pipelines.
:::

<Description>

Ingest, transform, and load streaming data into Apache Iceberg or Parquet in R2.

</Description>

<Plan type="paid" />

Cloudflare Pipelines ingests events, transforms them with SQL, and delivers them to R2 as [Iceberg tables](/r2/data-catalog/) or as Parquet and JSON files.

Whether you're processing server logs, mobile application events, IoT telemetry, or clickstream data, Pipelines provides durable ingestion via HTTP endpoints or Worker bindings, SQL-based transformations, and exactly-once delivery to R2. This makes it easy to build analytics-ready data warehouses and lakehouses without managing streaming infrastructure.

Create your first pipeline by following the [getting started guide](/pipelines/getting-started) or running this [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) command:

```sh
npx wrangler pipelines setup
```
