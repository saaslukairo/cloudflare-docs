    content: Cloudflare Pipelines - Pricing
---

Cloudflare Pipelines is in open beta and available to any developer with a [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/).

We are not currently billing for Pipelines during open beta. However, you will be billed for standard [R2 storage and operations](/r2/pricing/) for data written by sinks to R2 buckets.

We plan to bill based on the volume of data processed by pipelines, transformed by pipelines, and delivered to sinks. We'll provide at least 30 days notice before we make any changes or start charging for Pipelines usage.
