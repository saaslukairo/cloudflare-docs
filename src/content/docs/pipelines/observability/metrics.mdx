Pipelines expose metrics which allow you to measure data ingested, processed, and delivered to sinks.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) are queried from Cloudflare's [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

### Operator metrics

Pipelines export the below metrics within the `AccountPipelinesOperatorAdaptiveGroups` dataset. These metrics track data read and processed by pipeline operators.

| Metric        | GraphQL Field Name | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bytes In      | `bytesIn`          | Total number of bytes read by the pipeline (filter by `streamId_neq: ""` to get data read from streams)   |
| Records In    | `recordsIn`        | Total number of records read by the pipeline (filter by `streamId_neq: ""` to get data read from streams) |
| Decode Errors | `decodeErrors`     | Number of messages that could not be deserialized in the stream schema                                    |

The `AccountPipelinesOperatorAdaptiveGroups` dataset provides the following dimensions for filtering and grouping queries:

- `pipelineId` - ID of the pipeline
- `streamId` - ID of the source stream
- `datetime` - Timestamp of the operation
- `date` - Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of a day
- `datetimeHour` - Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of an hour

### Sink metrics

Pipelines export the below metrics within the `AccountPipelinesSinkAdaptiveGroups` dataset. These metrics track data delivery to sinks.

| Metric                     | GraphQL Field Name         | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bytes Written              | `bytesWritten`             | Total number of bytes written to the sink, after compression |
| Records Written            | `recordsWritten`           | Total number of records written to the sink                  |
| Files Written              | `filesWritten`             | Number of files written to the sink                          |
| Row Groups Written         | `rowGroupsWritten`         | Number of row groups written (for Parquet files)             |
| Uncompressed Bytes Written | `uncompressedBytesWritten` | Total number of bytes written before compression             |

The `AccountPipelinesSinkAdaptiveGroups` dataset provides the following dimensions for filtering and grouping queries:

- `pipelineId` - ID of the pipeline
- `sinkId` - ID of the destination sink
- `datetime` - Timestamp of the operation
- `date` - Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of a day
- `datetimeHour` - Timestamp of the operation, truncated to the start of an hour

## View metrics in the dashboard

Per-pipeline analytics are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a pipeline:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to **Pipelines** > **Pipelines**.
3. Select a pipeline.
4. Go to the **Metrics** tab to view its metrics.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your pipelines via the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same datasets as the Cloudflare dashboard and supports GraphQL [introspection](/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

Pipelines GraphQL datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID.

### Measure operator metrics over time period

This query returns the total bytes and records read by a pipeline from streams, along with any decode errors.

```graphql graphql-api-explorer
query PipelineOperatorMetrics(
	$accountTag: string!
	$pipelineId: string!
	$datetimeStart: Time!
	$datetimeEnd: Time!
) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			accountPipelinesOperatorAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					pipelineId: $pipelineId
					streamId_neq: ""
					datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
					datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
				}
			) {
				sum {
					bytesIn
					recordsIn
					decodeErrors
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Measure sink delivery metrics

This query returns detailed metrics about data written to a specific sink, including file and compression statistics.

```graphql graphql-api-explorer
query PipelineSinkMetrics(
	$accountTag: string!
	$pipelineId: string!
	$sinkId: string!
	$datetimeStart: Time!
	$datetimeEnd: Time!
) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			accountPipelinesSinkAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					pipelineId: $pipelineId
					sinkId: $sinkId
					datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
					datetime_leq: $datetimeEnd
				}
			) {
				sum {
					bytesWritten
					recordsWritten
					filesWritten
					rowGroupsWritten
					uncompressedBytesWritten
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
