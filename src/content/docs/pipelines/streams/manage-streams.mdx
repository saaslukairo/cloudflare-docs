Learn how to:

- Create and configure streams for data ingestion
- View and update stream settings
- Delete streams when no longer needed

## Create a stream

Streams are made available to pipelines as SQL tables using the stream name (e.g., `SELECT * FROM my_stream`).

### Dashboard

<Steps>
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Pipelines** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/pipelines/overview" />
2. Select **Create Pipeline** to launch the pipeline creation wizard.
3. Complete the wizard to create your stream along with the associated sink and pipeline.
</Steps>

### Wrangler CLI

To create a stream, run the [`pipelines streams create`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-streams-create) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines streams create <STREAM_NAME>
```

Alternatively, to use the interactive setup wizard that helps you configure a stream, sink, and pipeline, run the [`pipelines setup`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-setup) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines setup
```

### Schema configuration

Streams support two approaches for handling data:

- **Structured streams**: Define a schema with specific fields and data types. Events are validated against the schema.
- **Unstructured streams**: Accept any valid JSON without validation. These streams have a single `value` column containing the JSON data.

To create a structured stream, provide a schema file:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines streams create my-stream --schema-file schema.json
```

Example schema file:

```json
{
	"fields": [
		{
			"name": "user_id",
			"type": "string",
			"required": true
		},
		{
			"name": "amount",
			"type": "float64",
			"required": false
		},
		{
			"name": "tags",
			"type": "list",
			"required": false,
			"items": {
				"type": "string"
			}
		},
		{
			"name": "metadata",
			"type": "struct",
			"required": false,
			"fields": [
				{
					"name": "source",
					"type": "string",
					"required": false
				},
				{
					"name": "priority",
					"type": "int32",
					"required": false
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

**Supported data types:**

- `string` - Text values
- `int32`, `int64` - Integer numbers
- `float32`, `float64` - Floating-point numbers
- `bool` - Boolean true/false
- `timestamp` - RFC 3339 timestamps, or numeric values parsed as Unix seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds (depending on unit)
- `json` - JSON objects
- `binary` - Binary data (base64-encoded)
- `list` - Arrays of values
- `struct` - Nested objects with defined fields

:::note
Events that do not match the defined schema are accepted during ingestion but will be dropped during processing. Schema modifications are not supported after stream creation.
:::

## View stream configuration

### Dashboard

<Steps>
	1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Pipelines** > **Streams**.

    2. Select a stream to view its associated configuration.

</Steps>

### Wrangler CLI

To view a specific stream, run the [`pipelines streams get`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-streams-get) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines streams get <STREAM_ID>
```

To list all streams in your account, run the [`pipelines streams list`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-streams-list) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines streams list
```

## Update HTTP ingest settings

You can update certain HTTP ingest settings after stream creation. Schema modifications are not supported once a stream is created.

### Dashboard

<Steps>
	1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Pipelines** > **Streams**.

    2. Select the stream you want to update.

    3. In the **Settings** tab, navigate to **HTTP Ingest**.

    4. To enable or disable HTTP ingestion, select **Enable** or **Disable**.

    5. To update authentication and CORS settings, select **Edit** and modify.

    6. Save your changes.

</Steps>

:::note
For details on configuring authentication tokens and making authenticated requests, see [Writing to streams](/pipelines/streams/writing-to-streams/).

## Delete a stream

### Dashboard

<Steps>
	1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Pipelines** > **Streams**.

    2. Select the stream you want to delete.

    3. In the **Settings** tab, navigate to **General**, and select **Delete**.

</Steps>

### Wrangler CLI

To delete a stream, run the [`pipelines streams delete`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#pipelines-streams-delete) command:

```bash
npx wrangler pipelines streams delete <STREAM_ID>
```

:::caution
Deleting a stream will permanently remove all buffered events that have not been processed and will delete any dependent pipelines. Ensure all data has been delivered to your sink before deletion.
