## Create security records

To set up email security records:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **DMARC Management**.
3. In **Email record overview**, select **View records**.
4. Use the available options to set up [SPF](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/), [DKIM](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/), and [DMARC records](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/). This page will also list any previous records you might already have in your account.
