This guide will get you started with creating and managing configured Health Checks.

## Create a Health Check

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Health Checks** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/traffic/health-checks" />

2. Select **Create** and fill out the form, paying special attention to:
   - The values for **Interval** and **Check regions**, because decreasing the **Interval** and increasing **Check regions** may increase the load on your origin server.
   - **Retries**, which specify the number of retries to attempt in case of a timeout before marking the origin as unhealthy.
   - **Response body**, which specifies a substring that must be present in the first 10 KB of the response body for the check to succeed.
3. Select **Save and Deploy**.

## Manage Health Checks

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Traffic** > **Health Checks**.
3. Navigate to your health check and select **Edit**.
4. Edit your Health Check.
5. Select **Save**.
