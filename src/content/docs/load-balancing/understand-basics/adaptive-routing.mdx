Adaptive routing controls features that modify the routing of requests to pools and endpoints in response to dynamic conditions, such as during the interval between active health monitoring requests. <Render file="zero-downtime-failover-retry-on-error" product="fundamentals" />

## Failover across pools

When there are no healthy endpoints in the same pool, failover across pools extend the zero-downtime failover of requests to healthy endpoints in alternate pools according to the failover order defined by traffic and endpoint steering.

### Enable failover across pools

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Load Balancing** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/load-balancing" />

2. Navigate to your Load Balancers and select **Edit**.
3. From **Adaptive Routing**, enable **Failover across pools**.
