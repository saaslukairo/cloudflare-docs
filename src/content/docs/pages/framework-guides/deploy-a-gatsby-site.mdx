[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is an open-source React framework for creating websites and apps. In this guide, you will create a new Gatsby application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will be using the `gatsby` CLI to create a new Gatsby site.

## Install Gatsby

Install the `gatsby` CLI by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

## Create a new project

With Gatsby installed, you can create a new project using `gatsby new`. The `new` command accepts a GitHub URL for using an existing template. As an example, use the `gatsby-starter-lumen` template by running the following command in your terminal. You can find more in [Gatsby's Starters section](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?v=2):

```sh
npx gatsby new my-gatsby-site https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen
```

<Render file="tutorials-before-you-start" product="pages" />

<Render
	file="framework-guides/create-github-repository_no_init"
	product="pages"
/>

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

<Render
	file="deploy-to-pages-steps-with-preset"
	product="pages"
	params={{ name: "Gatsby" }}
	product="pages"
/>

<PagesBuildPreset framework="gatsby" />

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `gatsby`, your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

:::note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

:::

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.
Every time you commit new code to your Gatsby site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

## Dynamic routes

If you are using [dynamic routes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/routing/#dynamic-routing) in your Gatsby project, set up a [proxy redirect](/pages/configuration/redirects/#proxying) for these routes to take effect.

If you have a dynamic route, such as `/users/[id]`, create your proxy redirect by referring to the following example:

```
/users/* /users/:id 200
```

<Render
	file="framework-guides/learn-more"
	product="pages"
	params={{ one: "Gatsby" }}
/>
