[Remix](https://remix.run/) is a framework that focused on web standard. The framework is no longer recommended for new projects by the authors and its successor React Router should be used instead.

To start a new React Router project please refer to the [React Router Workers guide](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router).

And if you have an existing Remix application consider migrating it to React Router as described in the [official Remix upgrade documentation](https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/remix).
