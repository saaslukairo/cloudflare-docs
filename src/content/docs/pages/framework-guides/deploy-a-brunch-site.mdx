[Brunch](https://brunch.io/) is a fast front-end web application build tool with simple declarative configuration and seamless incremental compilation for rapid development.

## Install Brunch

To begin, install Brunch:

```sh
npm install -g brunch
```

## Create a Brunch project

Brunch maintains a library of community-provided [skeletons](https://brunch.io/skeletons) to offer you a boilerplate for your project. Run Brunch's recommended `es6` skeleton with the `brunch new` command:

```sh
brunch new proj -s es6
```

<Render file="tutorials-before-you-start" product="pages" />

<Render file="framework-guides/create-github-repository" product="pages" />

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

<Render
	file="framework-guides/learn-more"
	product="pages"
	params={{ name: "Brunch" }}
/>

<PagesBuildPreset framework="brunch" />

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.

Every time you commit new code to your Brunch site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests and be able to preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

<Render
	file="framework-guides/learn-more"
	product="pages"
	params={{ one: "Brunch" }}
/>
