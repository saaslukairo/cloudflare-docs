[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is an open-source React framework for creating websites and applications.

If you want to deploy a full stack Server Side Rendered Next.js application please refer to the [Next.js Workers guide](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs).

To instead deploy a static Next.js site using Pages see the [static Next.js Pages guide](/pages/framework-guides/nextjs/deploy-a-static-nextjs-site).
