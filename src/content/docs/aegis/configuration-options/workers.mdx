    content: Use Aegis with Cloudflare Workers

---

[Workers](/workers/) provides a serverless execution environment for you to create applications leveraging Cloudflare's global network.

Refer to the sections below for information on how Aegis pair up with Workers.

## `fetch`

[`fetch()` requests](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) that access services on your origin will use Aegis IP addresses.

Workers subrequests — requests from one Worker to another — are expected to use different IPs. However, [`fetch()` requests](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) to external origins made by a Worker invoked via a subrequest will use Aegis IP addresses.

## `connect`

For [`connect()` requests](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) - which create outbound TCP connections from Workers - Aegis IPs are **not** used.
