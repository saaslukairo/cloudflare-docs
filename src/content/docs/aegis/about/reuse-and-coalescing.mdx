Aside from [concurrent connections](/aegis/about/ips-allocation/#connections-to-your-origin)[^1], connection reuse and connection coalescing are also important concepts. They both have impact on latency and are considered when allocating your Aegis IPv4 addresses.

Refer to the [Cloudflare blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/aegis-deep-dive/) for further details.

[^1]: If you have one Aegis IP and two origins (A and B), this single Aegis IP can support 40,000 concurrent connections to origin A, while simultaneously supporting 40,000 concurrent connections to origin B.
