You can control Aegis enablement on your zones [via API](/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/). If you are not familiar with how Cloudflare API works, refer to [Fundamentals](/fundamentals/api/).

:::caution[Availability]
Cloudflare Aegis is available in early access to Enterprise customers. Contact your account team to request access.
:::

## Requirements

- The Aegis zone setting endpoint is only available within Cloudflare accounts that own leased IPs, or accounts to which a [BYOIP prefix](/byoip/) has been delegated. If you wish to use Aegis for zones that do not meet this criteria, contact your account team.
- Each Aegis pool can consist of either IPs from a BYOIP prefix or Cloudflare-leased IPs. A single dedicated egress pool cannot contain both BYOIPs and leased IPs.

## Turn on Aegis for a zone

1. Contact your account team to get the ID for your dedicated egress pool.
2. Make a `PATCH` request to the [Edit Zone Setting](/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) endpoint:
- Specify `aegis` as the setting ID in the URL.
- In the request body, set `enabled` to `true` and use the ID from the previous step as `pool_id`.

<APIRequest
  path="/zones/{zone_id}/settings/{setting_id}"
  method="PATCH"
  json={{
		  "id": "aegis",
			"value": {
				"enabled": true,
				"pool_id": "<YOUR_EGRESS_POOL_ID>",
				},
	}}
	parameters={{
    setting_id: "aegis",
  }}
/>

## Check your Aegis IPs

<Render
  file="check-leased-ips"
	product="byoip"
	params={{
		product: "Aegis IPs (dedicated IPs for CDN egress)"
	}}
/>

If you are using BYOIP, refer to [**IP addresses** > **BYOIP prefixes**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ip-addresses/ip-prefixes) instead.
