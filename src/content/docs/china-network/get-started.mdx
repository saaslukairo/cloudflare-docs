## 1. Contract required services and agree to supplemental terms

<Steps>

1. Ensure that you have a Cloudflare Enterprise plan. If you do not have an Enterprise plan yet, you must upgrade.
2. Add the Cloudflare China Network package (a separate subscription) to your Enterprise plan.
3. Agree to the [China Service Supplemental Terms](https://www.cloudflare.com/supplemental-terms/#china-service).

</Steps>

Contact your sales team for more information on these steps.

## 2. Obtain ICP and vet domain content

<Steps>

1. Obtain [Internet Content Provider filings or licenses](/china-network/concepts/icp/#obtain-an-icp-number) for all the apex domains you wish to onboard.

2. Present valid ICP filings or licenses for the zones you are onboarding.

3. Ensure that your websites [display their ICP number in the page footer](/china-network/concepts/icp/#display-your-icp-number).

4. Prepare the required information for JD Cloud to review your domains' content. JD Cloud, our partner, is required to review and vet the content of all domains on their network before China Network is enabled. You will need to provide the following information:
   - Customer and company name
   - Domain name
   - ICP license/filing number
   - A general description of the content of each domain (for example, Marketing website)
   - A signed Self Attestation letter (provided by your sales team)

</Steps>

## 3. Onboard your domains to the Cloudflare China Network

After content vetting is complete, [add your domains to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).

For first-time enablement of a zone, it will take approximately 24-48 hours to fully onboard to China Network. Afterwards, you can enable and disable China Network within your Cloudflare dashboard.
