Cloudflare Images allows developers to upload images using different methods, for a wide range of use cases.

## Supported image formats

You can upload the following image formats to Cloudflare Images:

* PNG
* GIF (including animations)
* JPEG
* WebP (Cloudflare Images also supports uploading animated WebP files)

Cloudflare can ingest HEIC images for decoding, but they must be served in web-safe formats such as AVIF, WebP, JPG, or PNG.
