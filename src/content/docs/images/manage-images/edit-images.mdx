The Edit option provides you available options to modify a specific image. After choosing to edit an image, you can:

- Require signed URLs to use with that particular image.
- Use a cURL command you can use as an example to access the image.
- Use fully-formed URLs for all the variants configured in your account.

To edit an image:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Transformations** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/images/transformations" />

2. Locate the image you want to modify and select **Edit**.
