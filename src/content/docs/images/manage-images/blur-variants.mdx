You can apply blur to image variants by creating a specific variant for this effect first or by editing a previously created variant. Note that you cannot blur an SVG file.

Refer to [Resize images](/images/manage-images/create-variants/) for help creating variants. You can also refer to the API to learn how to use blur using flexible variants.

To blur an image:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, got to the **Hosted Images** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/images/hosted" />

2. Select the **Delivery** tab.
3. Find the variant you want to blur and select **Edit** > **Customization Options**.
4. Use the slider to adjust the blurring effect. You can use the preview image to see how strong the blurring effect will be.
5. Select **Save**.

The image should now display the blurred effect.
