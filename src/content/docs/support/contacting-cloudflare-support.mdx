## Verifying your identity on phone calls

_(For Enterprise Emergency Phone Support)_

For account security, you must verify your identity and account ownership in the Cloudflare dashboard before discussing account settings and sensitive details with Cloudflare Support. There are two verification options:

- a single-use token that automatically refreshes every thirty (30) seconds, or
- an [authenticator app token](/fundamentals/user-profiles/2fa/#configure-totp-mobile-application-authentication) on your mobile device.

### Authenticating your account

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Support** page and select the account you are calling about.

<LinkButton href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/support" icon="external">Go to Support</LinkButton>

2. Click on the **Technical Support** tile and then the **Emergency Phone Line** tile.

3. To authenticate using a single-use token, click on the **Get a single-use token** button. A pop-up window will appear with your Unique Customer Id and One Time Passcode. The code automatically refreshes every 30 seconds.

4. To authenticate using an authenticator app, click **Configure authenticator app** and follow the [configuration instructions](/fundamentals/user-profiles/2fa/#configure-totp-mobile-application-authentication) on the following screen. After configuration, the token code will appear in your mobile authentication application.

## Service Level Agreements and Objectives

### How we prioritize your issue

Cloudflare support responds to every case received in the following priority order:

- Premium Enterprise
- Standard Enterprise
- Business
- Pro
- Free

Cloudflare Support strives to respond to our customers as quickly as possible. Urgent issues (site down, under attack) are prioritized for the quickest response possible. Please explicitly specify the priority level and impact to your production service when reaching out to Cloudflare support.

Below are definitions of the priority levels Cloudflare assigns to cases and the associated Service Level Agreement (SLA) or Service Level Objective (SLO). Whenever possible, responses are provided quicker than the noted SLAs.

### Priority definitions

- P1 Urgent- Critical Business Impact: Severe disruption to your business operations. This issue requires immediate and ongoing attention from both Cloudflare as well as yourself as it directly affects revenue, users, or business continuity.
  - _Example_: Your websites, applications, or services are completely unavailable or severely impaired across multiple regions or ISPs.
  - _Example_: A confirmed, active security attack is causing major disruptions, such as denial of service, data breaches, or account compromises.
- P2 High - High Business Impact: Significant but localized service or security disruption. While not a full outage, this issue affects business operations and requires urgent resolution.
  - _Example_: A recurring or persistent issue is affecting a portion of your users, such as degraded performance, intermittent outages, or limited accessibility.
  - _Example_: A past, confirmed security attack has resulted in measurable impact, requiring investigation and mitigation to prevent recurrence.
- P3 Normal -  Moderate Business Impact: Limited service impact or suspected security concerns. The issue does not pose an immediate risk but requires attention for continued reliability.
  - _Example_: Your service is operational, but you are experiencing minor disruptions, such as performance fluctuations, unexpected behavior, or non-critical bugs.
  - _Example_: A suspected security threat has been detected but is currently mitigated (e.g., an attack that Cloudflare successfully blocked).
- P4 Low - Low Business Impact: General inquiries and non-urgent requests. The issue does not impact your service availability or business operations.
  - _Example_: You are requesting feature enhancements or recommendations for improving security or performance.
  - _Example_: You have questions about Cloudflare’s products, documentation, or best practices.

### Premium SLA

- P1 Urgent- initial response in 1 hour
- P2 High - initial response in 2 hours 
- P3 Normal - initial response in 24 hours 
- P4 Low - initial response in 24 hours

### Enterprise SLA

- P1 Urgent - initial response in 2 hours
- P2 High - initial response in 4 hours
- P3 Normal - initial response in 48 hours
- P4 Low - initial response in 48 hours

### SLOs for other plans
