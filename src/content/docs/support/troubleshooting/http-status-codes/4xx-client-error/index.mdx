`4xx` codes are error responses that indicate an issue on the client's end, potentially due to a network problem.

- `4xx` codes can be used as a response to any request method.
- The origin server should include an explanation, which should be displayed by the User-Agent, except in the case of a `HEAD` request.
- [Custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) can return any response code in the range of `400–499` on your HTML page if the site owner has created a rule with the _Block_ action and configured a custom response code. For more details, refer to [custom response](/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/#configure-a-custom-response-for-blocked-requests).
