## Error 1002: DNS points to Prohibited IP

This error indicates that a Cloudflare DNS record points to a prohibited IP, preventing proper domain resolution.

### Common causes

- A DNS record in your Cloudflare DNS app points to one of [Cloudflare's IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).
- An incorrect target is specified for a CNAME record in your Cloudflare DNS app.
- Your domain is not on Cloudflare but has a CNAME that refers to a Cloudflare domain.

### Resolution

Update your Cloudflare A or CNAME record to point to your origin IP address instead of a Cloudflare IP address:

1. Contact your hosting provider to confirm your origin IP address or CNAME record target.

2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Records** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records" />

3. Select the domain that generates error 1002.
4. Select the **DNS** app.
5. Select **Value** for the A record to update.
6. Update the A record.

To ensure your origin web server does not proxy its own requests through Cloudflare, configure your origin webserver to resolve your Cloudflare domain to:

- The internal NAT'd IP address, or
- The public IP address of the origin web server.

## Error 1002: Restricted

This error indicates that the domain resolves to a restricted or disallowed IP address.

### Common cause

The Cloudflare domain resolves to a local or disallowed IP address or an IP address not associated with the domain.

### Resolution

If you own the website:

1. Confirm your origin web server IP addresses with your hosting provider,
2. Log in to your Cloudflare account, and
3. Update the A records in the Cloudflare DNS app to the IP address confirmed by your hosting provider.
