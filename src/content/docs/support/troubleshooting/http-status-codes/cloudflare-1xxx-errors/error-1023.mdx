## Error 1023: Could not find host

This error indicates that the host could not be found due to a configuration issue or propagation delay.

### Common causes

- If the owner just signed up for Cloudflare it can take a few minutes for the website's information to be distributed to our global network. Something is wrong with the site's configuration.
- Usually, this happens when accounts have been signed up with a partner organization (for example, hosting provider) and the provider's DNS fails.

:::note
Error `1023` is returned via a HTTP `503` response code.
