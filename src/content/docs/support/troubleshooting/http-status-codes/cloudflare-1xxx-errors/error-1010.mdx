## Error 1010: The owner of this website has banned your access based on your browser's signature

This error indicates that access to the website is denied based on your browser's signature.

### Common cause

A website owner blocked your request based on your client's web browser.

### Resolution

Notify the website owner of the blocking. If you cannot determine how to contact the website owner, lookup contact information for the domain via the [Whois database](https://lookup.icann.org/). Site owners can [turn off Browser Integrity Check](/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/#disable-browser-integrity-check) in the Security **Settings** page.

:::note
Since the website owner performed the blocking, Cloudflare support cannot override a customer's security settings.
