Cloudflare Logpush supports pushing logs directly to New Relic via the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.

## Manage via the Cloudflare dashboard

<Render file="enable-logpush-job" product="logs" />

4. In **Select a destination**, choose **New Relic**.

5. Enter the **New Relic Logs Endpoint**:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="US">

- `"https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`

</TabItem> <TabItem label="EU">

- `"https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Use the region that matches the one that has been set on your New Relic account. The **License key** field can be found on the New Relic dashboard. It can be retrieved by following [these steps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#manage-license-key).

When you are done entering the destination details, select **Continue**.

6. Select the dataset to push to the storage service.

7. In the next step, you need to configure your logpush job:
   - Enter the **Job name**.
   - Under **If logs match**, you can select the events to include and/or remove from your logs. Refer to [Filters](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/filters/) for more information. Not all datasets have this option available.
   - In **Send the following fields**, you can choose to either push all logs to your storage destination or selectively choose which logs you want to push.

8. In **Advanced Options**, you can:
   - Choose the format of timestamp fields in your logs (`RFC3339`(default),`Unix`, or `UnixNano`).
   - Select a [sampling rate](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/api-configuration/#sampling-rate) for your logs or push a randomly-sampled percentage of logs.
   - Enable redaction for `CVE-2021-44228`. This option will replace every occurrence of `${` with `x{`.

9. Select **Submit** once you are done configuring your logpush job.

## Manage via API

<Render file="enable-read-permissions" product="logs" />

### 1. Create a job

To create a job, make a `POST` request to the Logpush jobs endpoint with the following fields:

- **name** (optional) - Use your domain name as the job name.

- **output_options** (optional) - To configure fields, sample rate, and timestamp format, refer to [Log Output Options](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/log-output-options/).

  :::note[Note]

  To query Cloudflare logs, New Relic requires fields to be sent as a UNIX timestamp.

  :::

- **destination_conf** - A log destination consisting of an endpoint URL, a license key and a format in the string format below.
  - `<NR_ENDPOINT_URL>`: The New Relic HTTP logs intake endpoint, which is `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1` for US or `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1` for the EU, depending on the region that has been set on your New Relic account.
  - `<NR_LICENSE_KEY>`: This key can be found on the New Relic dashboard and it can be retrieved by following [these steps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#manage-license-key).
  - `format`: The format is `cloudflare`.

    US: `"https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`

    EU: `"https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare"`

- **max_upload_records** (optional) - The maximum number of log lines per batch. This must be at least 1,000 lines or more. Note that there is no way to specify a minimum number of log lines per batch. This means that log files may contain many fewer lines than specified.

- **max_upload_bytes** (optional) - The maximum uncompressed file size of a batch of logs. This must be at least 5 MB. Note that there is no way to set a minimum file size. This means that log files may be much smaller than this batch size. Nevertheless, it is recommended to set this parameter to 5,000,000.

- **dataset** - The category of logs you want to receive. Refer to [Datasets](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/) for the full list of supported datasets.

Example request using cURL:

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/logpush/jobs"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		name: "<DOMAIN_NAME>",
		output_options: {
			field_names: [
				"ClientIP",
				"ClientRequestHost",
				"ClientRequestMethod",
				"ClientRequestURI",
				"EdgeEndTimestamp",
				"EdgeResponseBytes",
				"EdgeResponseStatus",
				"EdgeStartTimestamp",
				"RayID",
			],
			timestamp_format: "unix",
		},
		destination_conf:
			"https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare",
		max_upload_bytes: 5000000,
		dataset: "http_requests",
		enabled: true,
	}}
/>

Response:

```json
{
  "errors": [],
  "messages": [],
  "result": {
    "dataset": "http_requests",
    "destination_conf": "https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare",
    "enabled": true,
    "error_message": null,
    "id": <JOB_ID>,
    "kind": "",
    "last_complete": null,
    "last_error": null,
    "output_options": {
      "field_names": ["ClientIP", "ClientRequestHost", "ClientRequestMethod", "ClientRequestURI", "EdgeEndTimestamp","EdgeResponseBytes", "EdgeResponseStatus", "EdgeStartTimestamp", "RayID"],
      "timestamp_format": "unix"
    },
    "max_upload_bytes": 5000000,
    "name": "<DOMAIN_NAME>"
  },
  "success": true
}
```

### 2. Enable (update) a job

To enable a job, make a `PUT` request to the Logpush jobs endpoint. You will use the job ID returned from the previous step in the URL and send `{"enabled": true}` in the request body.

Example request using cURL:

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/logpush/jobs/{job_id}"
	method="PUT"
	json={{
		enabled: true,
	}}
/>

Response:

```json
{
  "errors": [],
  "messages": [],
  "result": {
    "dataset": "http_requests",
    "destination_conf": "https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>&format=cloudflare",
    "enabled": true,
    "error_message": null,
     "id": <JOB_ID>,
     "kind": "",
     "last_complete": "null",
     "last_error": null,
     "output_options": {
       "field_names": ["ClientIP", "ClientRequestHost", "ClientRequestMethod", "ClientRequestURI", "EdgeEndTimestamp","EdgeResponseBytes", "EdgeResponseStatus", "EdgeStartTimestamp", "RayID"],
       "timestamp_format": "unix"
     },
     "max_upload_bytes": 5000000,
     "name": "<DOMAIN_NAME>"
  },
  "success": true
}
```
