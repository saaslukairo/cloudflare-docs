The following table represents the comparison operators that are supported and example values. Filters are added as escaped JSON strings formatted as `{"key":"<field>","operator":"<comparison_operator>","value":"<value>"}`.

- Refer to the [Datasets](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/) page for a list of fields related to each dataset.

- Comparison operators define how values must relate to fields in the log line for an expression to return true.

- Values represent the data associated with fields.

The filter field has limits of approximately 30 operators and 1000 bytes. Anything exceeding this value will return an error.

## Logical Operators

- Filters can be connected using `AND`, `OR` logical operators.

- Logical operators can be nested.

Here are some examples of how the logical operators can be implemented. `X`, `Y` and `Z` are used to represent filter criteria:

- X AND Y AND Z - `{"where":{"and":[{X},{Y},{Z}]}}`

- X OR Y OR Z - `{"where":{"or":[{X},{Y},{Z}]}}`

- X AND (Y OR Z) - `{"where":{"and":[{X}, {"or":[{Y},{Z}]}]}}`

- (X AND Y) OR Z - `{"where":{"or":[{"and": [{X},{Y}]},{Z}]}}`

## Set filters via API or dashboard

Filters can be set via API or the Cloudflare dashboard. Note that using a filter is optional, but if used, it must contain the `where` key.

### API

Here is an example request using cURL via API:

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/logpush/jobs"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		name: "static-assets",
		output_options: {
			field_names: ["ClientIP", "EdgeStartTimestamp", "RayID"],
			sample_rate: 0.1,
			timestamp_format: "rfc3339",
			"CVE-2021-44228": true,
		},
		dataset: "http_requests",
		filter: JSON.stringify({
			where: {
				and: [
					{ key: "ClientRequestPath", operator: "contains", value: "/static" },
					{ key: "ClientRequestHost", operator: "eq", value: "example.com" },
				],
			},
		}),
		destination_conf: "s3://<BUCKET_PATH>?region=us-west-2/",
	}}
/>

### Dashboard

To set filters through the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Logpush** page at the account or or domain (also known as zone) level.
 
   For account: <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/logs" />
 
   For domain (also known as zone): <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/analytics/logs" />


2. Select the dataset you want to push to a storage service. Depending on your choice, you have access to [account-scoped datasets](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/) and [zone-scoped datasets](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/), respectively.
3. Below **Select data fields**, in the **Filter** section, you can set up your filters.
4. You need to select a [dataset field](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/), an [Operator](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/filters/#logical-operators), and a **Value**.
5. You can connect more filters using `AND` and `OR` logical operators.
6. Select **Next** to continue the setting up of your Logpush job.
