A signed agent is controlled by an end user and a verified signature-agent from their Web Bot Auth implementation.

You can request for your agent to be added to Cloudflare's bots and agents directory by filling out an [online application](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/configurations/verified-bots) in the Cloudflare dashboard.

:::note
A bot cannot be registered as both a verified bot and a signed agent. Review Cloudflare's [verified bots](/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/) to determine how to identify your bot.

## Signed agent requirement

For an agent to be recognized, it must meet the following requirements:

1. The agent must follow the [signed agents policy](/bots/concepts/bot/signed-agents/policy/).
2. The bot must be using [Web Bot Auth](/bots/reference/bot-verification/web-bot-auth/).

Once Cloudflare approves a signed agent, it should appear on [Cloudflare Radar's bots and agents directory](https://radar.cloudflare.com/verified-bots).

## Verification method

The bot must be verified using [Web Bot Auth](/bots/reference/bot-verification/web-bot-auth/).
