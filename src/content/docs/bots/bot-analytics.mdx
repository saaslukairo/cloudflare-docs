## Business and Enterprise

Business and Enterprise customers without Bot Management can use **Bot Analytics** to dynamically examine bot traffic. These dashboards offer less functionality than Bot Management for Enterprise but still help you understand bot traffic on your domain.

### Access

You can access Bot Analytics by going to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and selecting your account and domain.

Old dashboard: **Security** > **Bots**.

New dashboard: **Security** > **Analytics** > **Bot analysis**.

### Features

For a full tour of Bot Analytics, see [our blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-bot-analytics/). At a high level, the tool includes:

- **Requests by traffic type**: View your total domain traffic segmented vertically by traffic type. Keep an eye on _automated_ and _likely automated_ traffic.
- **Requests by detection source**: Identify the most common detection engines used to score your traffic. Hover over a tooltip to learn more about each engine.
- **Top requests by attribute**: View more detailed information on specific IP addresses and other characteristics.

Bot Analytics shows up to 72 hours of data at a time and can display data up to 30 days old. Bot Analytics displays data in real time in most cases.
