### Set up a bot detection alert

To receive Bot alerts, you must [configure a notification](/notifications/get-started/). Notifications help you stay up to date with your Cloudflare account through email, PagerDuty, or webhooks, depending on your Cloudflare plan.

<Steps>
  1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Notifications** page.
  
      <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/notifications" />
  3. Select **Add**.
  4. Select **Bot Management** from the Product list.
  5. Choose one of the available bot detection alerts (depending on whether you want to set up custom filters and/or grouping):
      - Bot Detection Alert
      - Custom Bot Detection Alert
  6. Enter a notification name and (optionally) a description.
  7. Select the domain(s) to monitor for this alert.
  8. Configure a delivery method for the notification. The available delivery methods depend on your Cloudflare plan. For more information, refer to [Cloudflare Notifications](/notifications/).
  9. If you are creating a notification for Custom Bot Detection Alert, define the parameters that will filter the notifications you will receive.
  10. Select **Save**.

## Alert logic

The Bot Detection Alert notifies users when Cloudflare detects an abnormal spike to their zone where the Z-score > [3.5](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-thresholds-in-security-event-alerting-a-z-score-love-story/) and bot requests > 200/5 minutes in bot traffic (bot score < 30).

Z-score is calculated with a long window duration of six hours and short window duration of five minutes.

Bot Detection Alerts are delivered with Cloudflare’s Notifications system via email, webhook, or Pager Duty.

You will not receive duplicate alerts within the same one-hour time frame, except in rare cases where different alert values simultaneously trigger alerts.

In addition to the information above, Custom Bot Detection Alerts allow you to include or exclude certain conditions:

- User-agent
- Hostname
- URI Path
- IP Source Address
- AS Num
- JA3 Fingerprint
- JA4 Fingerprint
- Bot Detection IDs

You can also choose to group by the following dimensions so that they can be alerted of volumetric anomalies based on:

- JA4 Fingerprint (removes the filter of bot score < 30)
- AS Num
- Bot Detection IDs

:::note
Bot Detection Alerts exclude [verified bots](/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/).
