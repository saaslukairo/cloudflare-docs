## Enable auto-updates to the Machine Learning models

<Render file="latest-ml-model-enable" product="bots" />

### What will change

If you are on an older Machine Learning model, you will see a score change to requests scored by the **Machine Learning** source instantly. If you are already on the latest model, you will see changes only after a new Machine Learning model becomes the global default.

Customers will be notified via email and dashboard prior to a new Machine Learning model becoming the global default.

### Risks of not updating

By not updating to the latest version, you will be using a Machine Learning model no longer maintained or monitored by our engineering team. As Internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, scoring accuracy by older versions may degrade.

### Model versions and release notes

| Version | Release Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Launch Date |
