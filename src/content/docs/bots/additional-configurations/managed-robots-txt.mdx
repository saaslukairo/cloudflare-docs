Protect your website or application from AI crawlers by implementing a `robots.txt` file on your domain to direct AI bot operators on what content they can and cannot scrape for AI model training.

AI bots are expected to follow the `robots.txt` directives.

`robots.txt` files express your preferences. They do not prevent crawler operators from crawling your content at a technical level. Some crawler operators may disregard your `robots.txt` preferences and crawl your content regardless of what your `robots.txt` file says.  

:::note
Respecting `robots.txt` is voluntary. If you want to prevent crawling, use AI Crawl Control's [manage AI crawlers](/ai-crawl-control/features/manage-ai-crawlers/) feature.

## Compatibility with existing `robots.txt` files

Cloudflare will independently check whether your website has an existing `robots.txt` file and update the behavior of this feature based on your website.

### Existing robots.txt file

If your website already has a `robots.txt` file — verified by a HTTP `200` response — Cloudflare will prepend our managed `robots.txt` before your existing `robots.txt`, combining both into a single response.

For example, without this feature enabled, the `robots.txt` content of `crawlstop.com` would be:

```txt title="Feature not enabled"
User-agent: *
Disallow: /lp
Disallow: /feedback
Disallow: /langtest

Sitemap: https://www.crawlstop.com/sitemap.xml
```

With the managed `robots.txt` enabled, Cloudflare will prepend our managed content before your original content, resulting in what you can view at https://www.crawlstop.com/robots.txt.

```txt title="Feature enabled"
# As a condition of accessing this website, you agree to abide by the
# following content signals:

# (a)  If a content-signal = yes, you may collect content for the
#      corresponding use.
# (b)  If a content-signal = no, you may not collect content for the
#      corresponding use.
# (c)  If the website operator does not include a content signal for a
#      corresponding use, the website operator neither grants nor restricts
#      permission via content signal with respect to the corresponding use.

# The content signals and their meanings are:

# search: building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning
#         hyperlinks and short excerpts from your website's contents). Search
#         does not include providing AI-generated search summaries.
# ai-input: inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval
#           augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of
#           content for generative AI search answers).
# ai-train: training or fine-tuning AI models.

# ANY RESTRICTIONS EXPRESSED VIA CONTENT SIGNALS ARE EXPRESS RESERVATIONS OF
# RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVE 2019/790 ON COPYRIGHT
# AND RELATED RIGHTS IN THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET.

### No robots.txt file

If your website does not have a `robots.txt` file, Cloudflare creates a new file with our managed block directives and serves it for you.

## Implementation

To implement a `robots.txt` file on your domain:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav">
	<TabItem label="Old dashboard">
		<Steps>
			1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
			2. Go to **Security** > **Bots**.
			3. Select **Configure Bot Fight Mode**.
			4. Turn **Instruct bot traffic with robots.txt** on.
		</Steps>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">
		<Steps>
			1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.
				
				<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings" />
			2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
			3. Go to **robots.txt setting**.
			4. Turn **robots.txt setting** on.
		</Steps>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Content Signals Policy

Free zones that do not have their own `robots.txt` file and do not use the managed `robots.txt` feature will display the Content Signals Policy when a crawler requests the `robots.txt` file for your zone. 

This file only outlines the Content Signals framework. It does not express your preferences or rights associated with your content.

```txt title="Content Signals Policy"
# As a condition of accessing this website, you agree to abide by the
# following content signals:

# (a)  If a content-signal = yes, you may collect content for the
#      corresponding use.
# (b)  If a content-signal = no, you may not collect content for the
#      corresponding use.
# (c)  If the website operator does not include a content signal for a
#      corresponding use, the website operator neither grants nor restricts
#      permission via content signal with respect to the corresponding use.

# The content signals and their meanings are:

# search: building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning
#         hyperlinks and short excerpts from your website's contents). Search
#         does not include providing AI-generated search summaries.
# ai-input: inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval
#           augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of
#           content for generative AI search answers).
# ai-train: training or fine-tuning AI models.

# ANY RESTRICTIONS EXPRESSED VIA CONTENT SIGNALS ARE EXPRESS RESERVATIONS OF
# RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVE 2019/790 ON COPYRIGHT
# AND RELATED RIGHTS IN THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET.
```

Cloudflare's Content Signals Policy is included by default in the `robots.txt` file when you turn on **robots.txt setting**.

If you would like to opt out of displaying the policy in your `robots.txt` file, you can uncheck **Display Content Signals Policy** under **Control AI Crawlers** in your zone's overview.

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/" />

Alternatively, you can use [Security Settings](#implementation). 

:::caution
Google Search Console may occasionally report `Syntax not understood` for Content Signals and newer directives in the `robots.txt` standard. However, we have observed no impact on crawling rates or SEO as a result of these reports.
