Pro, Business, and Enterprise customers can use Cloudflare's bot solutions to protect their <GlossaryTooltip term="static content">static resources</GlossaryTooltip> from bots.

:::caution[Warning]

If you enable static resource protection, you may block good bots — like mail clients — that routinely fetch static resources. Make sure you understand your existing infrastructure before enabling this feature.

## Super Bot Fight Mode

      2. Go to **Security** > **Bots**.
      3. Select **Configure Super Bot Fight Mode**.
      4. For **Static resource protection**, select **On**.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">
		<Steps>
      1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security Settings** page.

          <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings" />
      2. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
      3. Go to **Super Bot Fight Mode**.
      4. Under **Configurations**, select the edit icon for **Static resource protection** and turn it on.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution

The **Static Resource Protection** setting will only activate if at least one of the bot categories (definite, likely, or verified) is _not_ set to `Allow`. If all categories are set to `Allow`, this setting will not have any impact since it works alongside these bot settings as part of the managed rules.
:::

## Bot Management for Enterprise

Static resources are protected by default when you create [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) using `cf.bot_management.score`.

To exclude static resources, you would need to include `not (cf.bot_management.static_resource)` as part of your custom rule.

## Which files are protected?

Static resources are files with the following extensions:

`ico|jpg|png|jpeg|gif|css|js|tif|tiff|bmp|pict|webp|svg|svgz|class|jar|txt|csv|doc|docx|xls|xlsx|pdf|ps|pls|ppt|pptx|ttf|otf|woff|woff2|eot|eps|ejs|swf|torrent|midi|mid|m3u8|m4a|mp3|ogg|ts`

Additionally, the `/.well-known/` URL path and all elements in it are considered a static resource, regardless of the file extension.
