Super Bot Fight Mode is included in your Pro, Business, or Enterprise subscription. When enabled, the product:

- Identifies traffic matching patterns of known bots
- Can challenge or block bots
- Offers protection for static resources
- Provides limited analytics to help you understand bot traffic

Accounts with an Enterprise subscription but not the [Bot Management add-on](/bots/get-started/bot-management/) will have Super Bot Fight Mode for Business.

## Considerations

<Render file="about-plan-considerations" product="bots" />

### WAF custom rules 

[WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) are executed before Super Bot Fight Mode.

This order has a critical impact on traffic processing. If a WAF custom rule performs a terminating action (such as _Block_, _Managed Challenge_, or _JS Challenge_), the request will not be processed further, and the Super Bot Fight Mode configuration will not be evaluated.

To configure exceptions to Super Bot Fight Mode, you should use the [_Skip_ action in your WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/skip/). The _Skip_ action allows the request to bypass the Super Bot Fight Mode phase without terminating the request, enabling it to continue through the rest of the security stack.

## Analytics

### Bot Report

Use the **Bot Report** to monitor bot traffic for the past 24 hours.

To access the **Bot Report**, go to **Security** > **Bots**. If you see a double-digit percentage of automated traffic, you may want to upgrade to [Bot Management](/bots/plans/bm-subscription/) to save money on origin costs and protect your domain from large-scale attacks.

![Example traffic distribution as part of a bot report](~/assets/images/bots/bot-report-pro.png)

### Security events

You can see bot-related actions by going to **Security** > **Events**. Any requests challenged by this product will be labeled **Super Bot Fight Mode** in the **Service** field. This allows you to observe, analyze, and follow trends in your bot traffic over time.
