Bot Management for Enterprise is a paid add-on that provides sophisticated bot protection for your domain. Customers can identify automated traffic, take appropriate action, and view detailed analytics within the dashboard.

This Enterprise product provides the most flexibility to customers by:

- Generating a [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) of 1-99 for every request. Scores below 30 are commonly associated with bot traffic.
- Allowing customers to take action on this score with [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) or [`Workers`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties).
- Allowing customers to view this score in Bot Analytics or Logs.

## Setup

Cloudflare recommends that you deploy the following basic settings and customize them according to the traffic in your zone.

### Enable the latest Machine Learning version

<Render file="latest-ml-model-enable" product="bots" />

### Block AI Bots

Refer to [Block AI bots](/bots/additional-configurations/block-ai-bots/).

:::note
You can view blocked AI bot traffic via [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/).
:::

### Deploy default templates

Cloudflare has [default templates](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules?template=bot_traffic) for definite bots, which have a [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) of 1, and likely bots which have a bot score of 2 to 29. In our templates, Cloudflare recommends to allow verified bots such as Google SEO Crawler and access to cached static resources.

- [Definite Bots template](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone:/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=Definitely%20Bots): Targets malicious bot traffic while ignoring verified bots and routes delivering static content.

    ```txt wrap
    (cf.bot_management.score eq 1 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot and not cf.bot_management.static_resource)
    ```

- [Likely Bots template](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=Likely%20Bots): Targets traffic likely to be malicious bots while ignoring verified bots and routes with static content. It may contain a small amount of non-bot traffic.

    ```txt wrap
    (cf.bot_management.score ge 2 and cf.bot_management.score le 29 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot and not cf.bot_management.static_resource)
    ```

- (Optional) [JavaScript detections template](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules/custom-rules/create?template=JavaScript%20Verified%20URLs): If you enabled JavaScript detections, then set up a [managed challenge](/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/challenge-pages/#managed-challenge-recommended), make sure to add a method and URI path. JavaScript detections improves security for URLs that should only expect JavaScript-enabled clients.

    ```txt wrap
    (not cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed and http.request.method eq "" and http.request.uri.path in {""})
    ```
