Grafana Cloud is a fully managed observability platform that provides visualization, alerting, and analytics for your telemetry data. By exporting your Cloudflare Workers telemetry to Grafana Cloud, you can:
- Visualize distributed traces in **Grafana Tempo** to understand request flows and performance bottlenecks
- Query and analyze logs in **Grafana Loki** alongside your traces

This guide will walk you through configuring Cloudflare Workers to export OpenTelemetry-compliant traces and logs to your Grafana Cloud stack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [Grafana Cloud account](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user) (free tier available)
- A deployed Worker that you want to monitor

## Step 1: Access the OpenTelemetry setup guide

1. Log in to your [Grafana Cloud portal](https://grafana.com/)
2. From your organization's home page, navigate to **Connections** → **Add new connection**
3. Search for "OpenTelemetry" and select **OpenTelemetry (OTLP)**
4. Select **Quickstart** then select **JavaScript**
6. Click **Create a new token**
7. Enter a name for your token (e.g., `cloudflare-workers-otel`) and click **create token**
8. Click on **Close** without copying the token
9. Copy and Save the value for `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` in the `Environment variables` code block as the OTel endpoint and as the Auth header value respectively


## Step 2: Set up destination 
1. Navigate to your Cloudflare account's [Workers Observability](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/pipelines) section
2. Click **Add destination** and configure a destination name (e.g. `grafana-tracing`)
3. From Grafana, copy your Otel endpoint, auth header, and auth value 
  * Your OTEL endpoint will look like `https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-2.grafana.net/otlp` (append `/v1/traces` for traces and `/v1/logs` for logs) 
  * Your custom header should include: 
      * Your auth header name `Authorization`
      * Your auth header value `Basic MTMxxx...`

## Step 3: Configure your Worker

With your destination created in the Cloudflare dashboard, update your Worker's configuration to enable telemetry export. 

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
  "observability": {
    "traces": {
      "enabled": true,
      // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
      "destinations": ["grafana-traces"]
    },
    "logs": {
      "enabled": true,
      // Must match the destination name in the dashboard
      "destinations": ["grafana-logs"]
    }
  }
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

After updating your configuration, deploy your Worker for the changes to take effect. 

:::note
It may take a few minutes after deployment for data to appear in Grafana Cloud.
