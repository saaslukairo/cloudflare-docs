import { WranglerConfig, Render, Steps } from "~/components";

Wrangler allows you to use environments to create different configurations for the same Worker application. Environments are configured in the Worker's [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

When you create an environment, Cloudflare effectively creates a new Worker with the name `<top-level-name>-<environment-name>`. For example, a Worker project named `my-worker` with an environment `dev` would deploy as a Worker named `my-worker-dev`.

Review the following environments flow:

<Steps>
1. Create a Worker, named `my-worker` for example.
2. Create an environment, for example `dev`, in the Worker's [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/), by adding a `[env.<ENV_NAME>]` section.

    <WranglerConfig>

    ```json
    {
    	"name": "my-worker",
    	"env": {
    		"<ENV_NAME>": {
    			// environment-specific configuration goes here
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```
    </WranglerConfig>

3.  You can configure the `dev` environment with different values to the top-level environment. Refer [here](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#environments) for how different options are inherited - or not inherited - between environments.
    For example, to set a different route for a Worker in the `dev` environment:

    <WranglerConfig>

    ```toml
    name = "your-worker"
    route = "example.com"

    [env.dev]
    route = "dev.example.com"
    ```

    </WranglerConfig>

4.  Environments are used with the `--env` or `-e` flag on Wrangler commands. For example, you can develop the Worker in the `dev` environment by running `npx wrangler dev -e=dev`, and deploy it with `npx wrangler deploy -e=dev`.

        <Render file="vite-environments" product="workers" />

</Steps>

## Non-inheritable keys and environments

[Non-inheritable keys](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#non-inheritable-keys) are configurable at the top-level, but cannot be inherited by environments and must be specified for each environment.

For example, [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) and [environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) are non-inheritable, and must be specified per [environment](/workers/wrangler/environments/) in your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

Review the following example Wrangler file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "my-worker"

vars = { API_HOST = "example.com" }

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "<BINDING_NAME>", id = "<KV_NAMESPACE_ID_DEV>" }
]

[env.production]

vars = { API_HOST = "production.example.com" }

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "<BINDING_NAME>", id = "<KV_NAMESPACE_ID_PRODUCTION>" }
]
```

</WranglerConfig>

### Service bindings

To use a [service binding](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#service-bindings) that targets a Worker in a specific environment, you need to append the environment name to the target Worker name in the `service` field. This should be in the format `<worker-name>-<environment-name>`.
In the example below, we have two Workers, both with a `staging` environment. `worker-b` has a service binding to `worker-a`. Note how the `service` field in the `staging` environment points to `worker-a-staging`, whereas the top-level service binding points to `worker-a`.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "worker-a"

vars = { FOO = "<top-level-var>" }
[env.staging.vars]
FOO = "<staging-var>"
```

</WranglerConfig>

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "worker-b"

services = { binding = "<BINDING_NAME>", service = "worker-a" }

# Note how `service = "worker-a-staging"`
env.staging.service ={ binding = "<BINDING_NAME>", service = "worker-a-staging" }
```

</WranglerConfig>

### Secrets for production

You may assign environment-specific [secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/) by running the command [`wrangler secret put <KEY> -env`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-put). You can also create `dotenv` type files named `.dev.vars.<environment-name>`.

Like other environment variables, secrets are [non-inheritable](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#non-inheritable-keys) and must be defined per environment.

## Examples

### Staging and production environments

The following Wrangler file adds two environments, `[env.staging]` and `[env.production]`, to the Wrangler file. If you are deploying to a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) or [route](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/), you must provide a [`route` or `routes` key](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for each environment.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "my-worker"
route = "dev.example.com/*"
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "dev" }

[env.staging]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "staging" }
route = "staging.example.com/*"

[env.production]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "production" }
routes = [
  "example.com/foo/*",
  "example.com/bar/*"
]
```

</WranglerConfig>

You can pass the name of the environment via the `--env` flag to run commands in a specific environment.

With this configuration, Wrangler will behave in the following manner:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

```sh output
Uploaded my-worker
Published my-worker
  dev.example.com/*
```

```sh
npx wrangler deploy --env staging
```

```sh output
Uploaded my-worker-staging
Published my-worker-staging
  staging.example.com/*
```

```sh
npx wrangler deploy --env production
```

```sh output
Uploaded my-worker-production
Published my-worker-production
  example.com/*
```

Any defined [environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) (the [`vars`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) key) are exposed as global variables to your Worker.

With this configuration, the `ENVIRONMENT` variable can be used to call specific code depending on the given environment:

```js
if (ENVIRONMENT === "staging") {
	// staging-specific code
} else if (ENVIRONMENT === "production") {
	// production-specific code
}
```

### Staging environment with \*.workers.dev

To deploy your code to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain, include `workers_dev = true` in the desired environment. Your Wrangler file may look like this:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "my-worker"
route = "example.com/*"

[env.staging]
workers_dev = true
```

</WranglerConfig>

With this configuration, Wrangler will behave in the following manner:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

```sh output
Uploaded my-worker
Published my-worker
  example.com/*
```

```sh
npx wrangler deploy --env staging
```

```sh output
Uploaded my-worker
Published my-worker
  https://my-worker-staging.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
```

:::caution

When you create a Worker via an environment, Cloudflare automatically creates an SSL certification for it. SSL certifications are discoverable and a matter of public record. Be careful when naming your environments that they do not contain sensitive information, such as, `migrating-service-from-company1-to-company2` or `company1-acquisition-load-test`.
