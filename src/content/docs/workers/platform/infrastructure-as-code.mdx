While [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/configuration) makes it easy to upload and manage Workers, there are times when you need a more programmatic approach. This could involve using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools or interacting directly with the [Workers API](/api/resources/workers/). Examples include build and deploy scripts, CI/CD pipelines, custom developer tools, and automated testing.

To make this easier, Cloudflare provides SDK libraries for popular languages such as [cloudflare-typescript](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript) and [cloudflare-python](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-python). For IaC, you can use tools like HashiCorp's Terraform and the [Cloudflare Terraform Provider](/terraform) to manage Workers resources.

Below are examples of deploying a Worker using different tools and languages, along with important considerations for managing Workers with IaC.

All of these examples need an [account ID](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids) and [API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token) (not Global API key) to work.

## Workers Bundling

None of the examples below do [Workers Bundling](/workers/wrangler/bundling). This is usually done with Wrangler or a tool like [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io).

Generally, you'd run this bundling step before applying your Terraform plan or using the API for script upload:

```bash
wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir build
```

When using Wrangler for building and a different method for uploading, make sure to copy all of your config from `wrangler.json` into your Terraform config or API request. This is especially important with `compatibility_date` or flags your script relies on.

## Terraform

In this example, you need a local file named `my-script.mjs` with script content similar to the below examples. Learn more about the Cloudflare Terraform Provider [here](/terraform), and see an example with all the Workers script resource settings [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/blob/main/examples/resources/cloudflare_workers_script/resource.tf).

```tf
variable "account_id" {
  default = "replace_me"
}

resource "cloudflare_worker" "my_worker" {
  account_id = var.account_id
  name = "my-worker"
  observability = {
    enabled = true
  }
}

resource "cloudflare_worker_version" "my_worker_version" {
  account_id = var.account_id
  worker_id = cloudflare_worker.my_worker.id
  compatibility_date = "$today"
  main_module = "my-script.mjs"
  modules = [
    {
      name = "my-script.mjs"
      content_type = "application/javascript+module"
      # Replacement (version creation) is triggered whenever this file changes
      content_file = "my-script.mjs"
    }
  ]
}

resource "cloudflare_workers_deployment" "my_worker_deployment" {
  account_id = var.account_id
  script_name = cloudflare_worker.my_worker.name
  strategy = "percentage"
  versions = [{
    percentage = 100
    version_id = cloudflare_worker_version.my_worker_version.id
  }]
}
```

Notice how you don't have to manage all of these resources in Terraform. For example, you could just the `cloudflare_worker` resource and seamlessly use Wrangler or your own deployment tools for Versions or Deployments.

## Cloudflare API Libraries

This example uses the [cloudflare-typescript](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript) SDK which provides convenient access to the Cloudflare REST API from server-side JavaScript or TypeScript.

<GitHubCode
	repo="cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript"
	file="examples/workers/script-upload.ts"
	commit="cb55a45d615425f6aaf9ee8a237d2c5424bf30b7"
	lang="ts"
	useTypeScriptExample={true}
/>

## Cloudflare REST API

Open a terminal or create a shell script to upload a Worker and manage versions and deployments with curl. Workers scripts are JavaScript [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), but we also support [Python Workers](/workers/languages/python/) (open beta) and [Rust Workers](/workers/languages/rust/).

:::note[Warning]

This API is in beta. See the multipart/form-data API below for the stable API.

### multipart/form-data upload API

This API uses [multipart/form-data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) to upload a Worker and will implicitly create a version and deployment. The above API is recommended for direct management of versions and deployments.

<Tabs syncKey="workers-vs-platforms" IconComponent={Icon}>
<TabItem icon="workers" label="Workers">

```bash
account_id="replace_me"
api_token="replace_me"
worker_name="my-hello-world-script"

script_content='export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response(env.MESSAGE, { status: 200 });
  }
};'

# Upload the Worker
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$account_id/workers/scripts/$worker_name" \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $api_token" \
  -F "metadata={
    'main_module': '"$worker_name".mjs',
    'bindings': [
      {
        'type': 'plain_text',
        'name': 'MESSAGE',
        'text': 'Hello World!'
      }
    ],
    'compatibility_date': '$today'
  };type=application/json" \
  -F "$worker_name.mjs=@-;filename=$worker_name.mjs;type=application/javascript+module" <<EOF
$script_content
EOF
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem icon="cloudflare-for-platforms" label="Workers for Platforms">

For [Workers for Platforms](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms), you can upload a [User Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/user-workers) to a [dispatch namespace](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dispatch-namespace). Note the [API endpoint](/api/resources/workers_for_platforms/subresources/dispatch/subresources/namespaces/subresources/scripts/methods/update/) is on `/workers/dispatch/namespaces/$DISPATCH_NAMESPACE/scripts/$SCRIPT_NAME`.

```bash
account_id="replace_me"
api_token="replace_me"
dispatch_namespace="replace_me"
worker_name="my-hello-world-script"

script_content='export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response(env.MESSAGE, { status: 200 });
  }
};'

# Create a dispatch namespace

  -X POST \

$script_content
EOF
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Python Workers

[Python Workers](/workers/languages/python/) (open beta) have their own special `text/x-python` content type and `python_workers` compatibility flag for uploading using the multipart/form-data API.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/workers/scripts/my-hello-world-script \
  -X PUT \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
  -F 'metadata={
        "main_module": "my-hello-world-script.py",
        "bindings": [
          {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "name": "MESSAGE",
            "text": "Hello World!"
          }
        ],
        "compatibility_date": "$today",
        "compatibility_flags": [
          "python_workers"
        ]
      };type=application/json' \
  -F 'my-hello-world-script.py=@-;filename=my-hello-world-script.py;type=text/x-python' <<EOF
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response(self.env.MESSAGE)
EOF
```

## Considerations with Durable Objects

[Durable Object](/durable-objects/) migrations are applied with deployments. This means you can't bind to a Durable Object in a Version if a deployment doesn't exist i.e. migrations haven't been applied. For example, running this in Terraform will fail the first time the plan is applied:

```tf
resource "cloudflare_worker" "my_worker" {
  account_id = var.account_id
  name = "my-worker"
}

resource "cloudflare_worker_version" "my_worker_version" {
  account_id = var.account_id
  worker_id = cloudflare_worker.my_worker.id
  bindings = [
    {
      type = "durable_object"
      name = "my_durable_object"
      class_name = "MyDurableObjectClass"
    }
  ]
  migrations = {
    new_sqlite_classes = [
      "MyDurableObjectClass"
    ]
  }
  # ...version props ommitted for brevity
}

resource "cloudflare_workers_deployment" "my_worker_deployment" {
  # ...deployment props ommitted for brevity
}
```

To make this succeed, you first have to comment out the `durable_object` binding block, apply the plan, uncomment it, comment out the `migrations` block, then apply again. This time the plan will succeed. This also applies to the API or SDKs. This is an example where it makes sense to just manage the `cloudflare_worker` and/or `cloudflare_workers_deployment` resources while using Wrangler for build and Version management.
