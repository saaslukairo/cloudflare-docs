## Fetch Handler

As mentioned in the [introduction to Python Workers](/workers/languages/python/), a Python Worker can be as simple as four lines of code:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response("Hello World!")
```

Similar to other Workers, the main entry point for a Python worker is the [`fetch` handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch) which handles incoming requests
sent to the Worker.

In a Python Worker, this handler is placed in a `Default` class that extends the `WorkerEntrypoint` class (which you can import from the `workers` SDK module).

## The `Request` Interface

The `request` parameter passed to your `fetch` handler is a JavaScript Request object, exposed via the [foreign function interface (FFI)](/workers/languages/python/ffi),
allowing you to access it directly from your Python code.

Let's try editing the worker to accept a POST request. We know from the
[documentation for `Request`](/workers/runtime-apis/request) that we can call
`await request.json()` within an `async` function to parse the request body as
JSON.

In a Python Worker, you would write:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response
from hello import hello

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        name = (await request.json()).name
        return Response(hello(name))
```

Many other JavaScript APIs are available in Python Workers via the FFI, so you can
call other methods in a similar way.

Once you edit the `src/entry.py`, Wrangler will automatically restart the local
development server.

Now, if you send a POST request with the appropriate body,
your Worker will respond with a personalized message.

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"name": "Python"}' http://localhost:8787
```

```bash output
Hello, Python!
```

## The `env` Attribute

The `env` attribute on the `WorkerEntrypoint` can be used to access
[environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/),
[secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/),and
[bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/).

For example, let us try setting and using an environment variable in a Python Worker. First, add the environment variable to your Worker's [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "hello-python-worker"
main = "src/entry.py"
compatibility_flags = ["python_workers"]
compatibility_date = "2025-11-02"

[vars]
API_HOST = "example.com"
```

</WranglerConfig>

Then, you can access the `API_HOST` environment variable via the `env` parameter:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response(self.env.API_HOST)
```

## Modules

Python workers can be split across multiple files.

Let's create a new Python file, called `src/hello.py`:

```python
def hello(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

Now, we can modify `src/entry.py` to make use of the new module.

```python
from hello import hello
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response(hello("World"))
```

Once you edit `src/entry.py`, [`pywrangler`](/workers/languages/python/#the-pywrangler-cli-tool) will automatically detect the change and
reload your Worker.

## Types and Autocompletion

When developing Python Workers, you can take advantage of type hints and autocompletion
in your IDE.

To enable them, install the `workers-runtime-sdk` package in your `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "workers-py",
    "workers-runtime-sdk"
]
```

Additionally, you can generate types based on your Worker configuration using `uv run pywrangler types`

This includes Env types based on your bindings, module rules, and runtime types based on the compatibility_date
and compatibility_flags in your config file.

## Upgrading `pywrangler`

To upgrade to the latest version of [`pywrangler`](/workers/languages/python/#the-pywrangler-cli-tool) globally, run the following command:

```bash
uv tool upgrade workers-py
```

To upgrade to the latest version of `pywrangler` in a specific project, run the following command:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package workers-py
```
