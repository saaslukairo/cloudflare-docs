import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

Cloudflare Workers provides a first-class Python experience, including support for:

- Easy to install and fast-booting [Packages](/workers/languages/python/packages), including [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Langchain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/), [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and more.
- A robust [foreign function interface (FFI)](/workers/languages/python/ffi) that lets you use JavaScript objects and functions directly from Python — including all [Runtime APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/)
- An ecosystem of services on the Workers Platform accessible via [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/), including:
  - State storage and databases like [KV](/kv), [D1](/d1), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/)
  - Access to [Environment Variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/), [Secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/), and other Workers using [Service Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/)
  - AI capabilities with [Workers AI](/workers-ai/), [Vectorize](/vectorize)
  - File storage with [R2](/r2)
  - [Durable Workflows](/workflows/), [Queues](/queues/), and [ more](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)

## Introduction

A Python Worker can be as simple as four lines of code:

```python
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response("Hello World!")
```

Similar to other Workers, the main entry point for a Python worker is the [`fetch` handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch) which handles incoming requests
sent to the Worker.

In a Python Worker, this handler is placed in a `Default` class that extends the `WorkerEntrypoint` class (which you can import from the `workers` SDK module).

:::caution[Python Workers are in beta.]

You must add the `python_workers` compatibility flag to your Worker, while Python Workers are in open beta. Packages are supported using the [pywrangler](/workers/languages/python/packages) tool.

We'd love your feedback. Join the #python-workers channel in the [Cloudflare Developers Discord](https://discord.cloudflare.com/) and let us know what you'd like to see next.

### The `pywrangler` CLI tool

To run a Python Worker locally, install packages, and deploy it to Cloudflare, you use [pywrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-py),
the CLI for Python Workers.

To set it up, first, ensure [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) are installed.

Then set up your development environment:

```
uv init
uv tool install workers-py
uv run pywrangler init
```

This will create a `pyproject.toml` file with `workers-py` as a development
dependency. `pywrangler init` will create a wrangler config file. You can then
run `pywrangler` with:

```bash
uv run pywrangler dev
```

To deploy a Python Worker to Cloudflare, run `pywrangler deploy`:

```bash
uv run pywrangler deploy
```

### Python Worker Templates

When you initialize a new Python Worker project and select from one of many templates:

```bash
uv run pywrangler init
```

Or you can clone the examples repository to explore more options:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/python-workers-examples
cd python-workers-examples/01-hello
```
