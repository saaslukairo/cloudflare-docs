**Start from CLI**: Scaffold an Astro project on Workers, and pick your template.

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-astro-app --framework=astro"
/>

---

**Or just deploy**: Create a static blog with Astro and deploy it on Cloudflare Workers, with CI/CD and previews all set up for you.

[![Deploy to Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create/deploy-to-workers&repository=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/astro-blog-starter-template)

## What is Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a JavaScript web framework designed for creating websites that display large amounts of content (such as blogs, documentation sites, or online stores).

Astro emphasizes performance through minimal client-side JavaScript - by default, it renders as much content as possible at build time, or [on-demand](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) on the "server" - this can be a Cloudflare Worker. [“Islands”](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) of JavaScript are added only where interactivity or personalization is needed.

Astro is also framework-agnostic, and supports every major UI framework, including React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, SolidJS, via its official [integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/).

## Deploy a new Astro project on Workers

<Steps>
1. **Create a new project with the create-cloudflare CLI (C3).**
    <PackageManagers
    	type="create"
    	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
    	args="my-astro-app --framework=astro"
    />

     <Details header="What's happening behind the scenes?">
     When you run this command, C3 creates a new project directory, initiates [Astro's official setup tool](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/1-setup/2/), and configures the project for Cloudflare. It then offers the option to instantly deploy your application to Cloudflare.

    </Details>

2.  **Develop locally.**

        After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server.

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

3.  **Deploy your project.**

        You can deploy your project to a [`*.workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [custom domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) from your local machine or any CI/CD system (including [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/#workers-builds)). Use the following command to build and deploy. If you're using a CI service, be sure to update your "deploy command" accordingly.

        <PackageManagers type="run" args="deploy" />

  </Steps>

## Deploy an existing Astro project on Workers

### If you have a static site

If your Astro project is entirely pre-rendered, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1.  **Add a Wrangler configuration file**

    In your project root, create a Wrangler configuration file with the following content:

    <WranglerConfig>

    ```json
    {
    	"name": "my-astro-app",
    	"compatibility_date": "$today",
    	"assets": {
    		"directory": "./dist"
    	}
    }
    ```

    </WranglerConfig>
    <Details header="What's this configuration doing?">
    	The key part of this config is the `assets` field, which tells Wrangler where to find your static assets. In this case, we're telling Wrangler to look in the `./dist` directory. If your assets are in a different directory, update the `directory` value accordingly.
    		Read about other [asset configuration options](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#assets).

    			Also note how there's no `main` field in this config - this is because you're only serving static assets, so no Worker code is needed for on demand rendering/SSR.
    </Details>

2.  **Build and deploy your project**

        		You can deploy your project to a [`*.workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [custom domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) from your local machine or any CI/CD system (including [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/#workers-builds)). Use the following command to build and deploy. If you're using a CI service, be sure to update your "deploy command" accordingly.

        		<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="build" />
        		<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="wrangler@latest" args="deploy" />

</Steps>

### If your site uses on demand rendering

If your Astro project uses [on demand rendering (also known as SSR)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/), follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. **Install the Astro Cloudflare adapter**
		<PackageManagers
			type="exec"
			pkg="astro"
			args="add cloudflare"
		/>

    	<Details header="What's happening behind the scenes?">
    		This command installs the Cloudflare adapter and makes the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step. By default, this sets the build output configuration to `output: 'server'`, which server renders all your pages by default. If there are certain pages that *don't* need on demand rendering/SSR, for example static pages like a privacy policy, you should set `export const prerender = true` for that page or route to pre-render it. You can read more about the adapter configuration options [in the Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#options).
    	</Details>

2.  **Add a `.assetsignore` file**
    Create a `.assetsignore` file in your `public/` folder, and add the following lines to it:

    ```txt title=".assetsignore"
    _worker.js
    _routes.json
    ```

3.  **Add a Wrangler configuration file**

        In your project root, create a Wrangler configuration file with the following content:

        <WranglerConfig>
        ```json
        {
        	"name": "my-astro-app",
        	"main": "./dist/_worker.js/index.js",
        	// Update to today's date
        	"compatibility_date": "2025-03-25",
        	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
        	"assets": {
        		"binding": "ASSETS",
        		"directory": "./dist"
        	},
        	"observability": {
        		"enabled": true
        	}
        }
        ```
        </WranglerConfig>
        <Details header="What's this configuration doing?">
        	The key parts of this config are:
        	- `main` points to the entry point of your Worker script. This is generated by the Astro adapter, and is what powers your server-rendered pages.
        	- `assets.directory` tells Wrangler where to find your static assets. In this case, we're telling Wrangler to look in the `./dist` directory. If your assets are in a different directory, update the `directory` value accordingly.

        	Read more about [Wrangler configuration options](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) and [asset configuration options](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#assets).
        </Details>

4.  **Build and deploy your project**

        		You can deploy your project to a [`*.workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [custom domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) from your local machine or any CI/CD system (including [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/#workers-builds)). Use the following command to build and deploy. If you're using a CI service, be sure to update your "deploy command" accordingly.

        		<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="astro" args="build" />
        		<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="wrangler@latest" args="deploy" />

</Steps>

## Bindings

:::note
You cannot use bindings if you're using Astro to generate a purely static site.
:::

With bindings, your Astro application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, giving you access to compute, storage, AI and more. Refer to the [bindings overview](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) for more information on what's available and how to configure them.

The [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#cloudflare-runtime) provide information about how you can access them in your `locals`.

## Astro's build configuration

The Astro Cloudflare adapter sets the build output configuration to `output: 'server'`, which means all pages are rendered on-demand in your Cloudflare Worker. If there are certain pages that _don't_ need on demand rendering/SSR, for example static pages such as a privacy policy, you should set `export const prerender = true` for that page or route to pre-render it. You can read more about on-demand rendering [in the Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/).

If you want to use Astro as a static site generator, you do not need the Astro Cloudflare adapter. Astro will pre-render all pages at build time by default, and you can simply upload those static assets to be served by Cloudflare.
