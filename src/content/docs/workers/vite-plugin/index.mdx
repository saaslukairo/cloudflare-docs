description: A full-featured integration between Vite and the Workers runtime
---

The Cloudflare Vite plugin enables a full-featured integration between [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and the [Workers runtime](/workers/runtime-apis/).
Your Worker code runs inside [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), matching the production behavior as closely as possible and providing confidence as you develop and deploy your applications.

## Features

- Uses the Vite [Environment API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-environment) to integrate Vite with the Workers runtime
- Provides direct access to [Workers runtime APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/) and [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)
- Builds your front-end assets for deployment to Cloudflare, enabling you to build static sites, SPAs, and full-stack applications
- Official support for [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/) and [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) with server-side rendering
- Leverages Vite's hot module replacement for consistently fast updates
- Supports `vite preview` for previewing your build output in the Workers runtime prior to deployment

## Use cases

- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/)
- [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/)
- Static sites, such as single-page applications, with or without an integrated backend API
- Standalone Workers
- Multi-Worker applications

## Get started

To create a new application from a ready-to-go template, refer to the [TanStack Start](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/tanstack-start/), [React Router](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/), [React](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/) or [Vue](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/vue/) framework guides.

To create a standalone Worker from scratch, refer to [Get started](/workers/vite-plugin/get-started/).

For a more in-depth look at adapting an existing Vite project and an introduction to key concepts, refer to the [Tutorial](/workers/vite-plugin/tutorial/).
