:::note
This guide demonstrates creating a standalone Worker from scratch.
If you would instead like to create a new application from a ready-to-go template, refer to the [TanStack Start](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/tanstack-start/), [React Router](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/), [React](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/) or [Vue](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/vue/) framework guides.

## Start with a basic `package.json`

```json title="package.json"
{
	"name": "cloudflare-vite-get-started",
	"private": true,
	"version": "0.0.0",
	"type": "module",
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "vite dev",
		"build": "vite build",
		"preview": "npm run build && vite preview",
		"deploy": "npm run build && wrangler deploy"
	}
}
```

:::note
Ensure that you include `"type": "module"` in order to use ES modules by default.

## Install the dependencies

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="vite @cloudflare/vite-plugin wrangler" dev />

## Create your Vite config file and include the Cloudflare plugin

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [cloudflare()],
});
```

The Cloudflare Vite plugin doesn't require any configuration by default and will look for a `wrangler.jsonc`, `wrangler.json` or `wrangler.toml` in the root of your application.

Refer to the [API reference](/workers/vite-plugin/reference/api/) for configuration options.

## Create your Worker config file

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "cloudflare-vite-get-started"
compatibility_date = "2025-04-03"
main = "./src/index.ts"
```

</WranglerConfig>

The `name` field specifies the name of your Worker.
By default, this is also used as the name of the Worker's Vite Environment (see [Vite Environments](/workers/vite-plugin/reference/vite-environments/) for more information).
The `main` field specifies the entry file for your Worker code.

For more information about the Worker configuration, see [Configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

## Create your Worker entry file

```ts title="src/index.ts"
export default {
	fetch() {
		return new Response(`Running in ${navigator.userAgent}!`);
	},
};
```

A request to this Worker will return **'Running in Cloudflare-Workers!'**, demonstrating that the code is running inside the Workers runtime.

## Dev, build, preview and deploy

You can now start the Vite development server (`npm run dev`), build the application (`npm run build`), preview the built application (`npm run preview`), and deploy to Cloudflare (`npm run deploy`).
