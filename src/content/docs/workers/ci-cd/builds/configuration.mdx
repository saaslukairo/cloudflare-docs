When connecting your Git repository to your Worker, you can customize the configurations needed to build and deploy your Worker.

## Build settings

Build settings can be found by navigating to **Settings** > **Build** within your Worker.

Note that when you update and save build settings, the updated settings will be applied to your _next_ build. When you _retry_ a build, the build configurations that exist when the build is retried will be applied.

This is necessary, for example, when using a [front-end framework](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#framework-support) such as Next.js or Remix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Your deploy command will default to `npx wrangler deploy` but you may customize this command. Workers Builds will use the Wrangler version set in your `package json`.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

By default, Cloudflare will automatically generate an API token for your account when using Workers Builds, and continue to use this API token for all subsequent builds. Alternatively, you can [create your own API token](/workers/wrangler/migration/v1-to-v2/wrangler-legacy/authentication/#generate-tokens), or select one that you already own. |

:::note
Currently, Workers Builds does not honor the configurations set in [Custom Builds](/workers/wrangler/custom-builds/) within your wrangler.toml file.

### Deploy command

You can run your deploy command using the package manager of your choice.

If you have added a Wrangler deploy command as a script in your `package.json`, then you can run it by setting it as your deploy command. For example, `npm run deploy`.

Examples of other deploy commands you can set include:

| Example Command                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx wrangler deploy --assets ./public/` | Deploy your Worker along with static assets from the specified directory. Alternatively, you can use the [assets binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/).                                                                                                                     |
| `npx wrangler deploy --env staging`      | If you have a [Wrangler environment](/workers/ci-cd/builds/advanced-setups/#wrangler-environments) Worker, you should set your deploy command with the environment flag. For more details, see [Advanced Setups](/workers/ci-cd/builds/advanced-setups/#wrangler-environments). |

### Non-production branch deploy command

The non-production branch deploy command is only applicable when you have enabled [non-production branch builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-branches/#configure-non-production-branch-builds).

It defaults to `npx wrangler versions upload`, producing a [preview URL](/workers/configuration/previews/). Like the build and deploy commands, it can be customized to instead run anything.

Examples of other non-production branch deploy commands you can set include:

| Example Command                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn exec wrangler versions upload`         | You can customize the package manager used to run Wrangler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `npx wrangler versions upload --env staging` | If you have a [Wrangler environment](/workers/ci-cd/builds/advanced-setups/#wrangler-environments) Worker, you should set your non-production branch deploy command with the environment flag. For more details, see [Advanced Setups](/workers/ci-cd/builds/advanced-setups/#wrangler-environments). |

### API token

The API token in Workers Builds defines the access granted to Workers Builds for interacting with your account's resources. Currently, only user tokens are supported, with account-owned token support coming soon.

When you select **Create new token**, a new API token will be created automatically with the following permissions:

- **Account:** Account Settings (read), Workers Scripts (edit), Workers KV Storage (edit), Workers R2 Storage (edit)
- **Zone:** Workers Routes (edit) for all zones on the account
- **User:** User Details (read), Memberships (read)

You can configure the permissions of this API token by navigating to **My Profile** > **API Tokens** for user tokens.

It is recommended to consistently use the same API token across all uploads and deployments of your Worker to maintain consistent access permissions.

## Framework support

[Static assets](/workers/static-assets/) and [frameworks](/workers/framework-guides/) are now supported in Cloudflare Workers. Learn to set up Workers projects and the commands for each framework in the framework guides:

<DirectoryListing folder="workers/framework-guides" maxDepth={4} />

## Environment variables

You can provide custom environment variables to your build.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Dashboard">

	To add environment variables via the dashboard:

  1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages" />

	2. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
	3. Select **Settings** > **Environment variables**.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Wrangler">
    To add env variables using Wrangler, define text and JSON via the `[vars]` configuration in your Wrangler file.

		<Render file="envvar-example" product="workers" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Default variables

The following system environment variables are injected by default (but can be overridden):

| Environment Variable    | Injected value                  | Example use-case                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CI`                    | `true`                          | Changing build behaviour when run on CI versus locally                                  |
| `WORKERS_CI`            | `1`                             | Changing build behaviour when run on Workers Builds versus locally                      |
| `WORKERS_CI_BUILD_UUID` | `<build-uuid-of-current-build>` | Passing the Build UUID along to custom workflows                                        |
| `WORKERS_CI_COMMIT_SHA` | `<sha1-hash-of-current-commit>` | Passing current commit ID to error reporting, for example, Sentry                       |
| `WORKERS_CI_BRANCH`     | `<branch-name-from-push-event`  | Customizing build based on branch, for example, disabling debug logging on `production` |
