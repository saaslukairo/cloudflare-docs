Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications which are client-side rendered (CSR). They are often built with a framework such as [React](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/), [Vue](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/vue/) or [Svelte](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/svelte/). The build process of these frameworks will produce a single `/index.html` file and accompanying client-side resources (e.g. JavaScript bundles, CSS stylesheets, images, fonts, etc.). Typically, data is fetched by the client from an API with client-side requests.

When you configure `single-page-application` mode, Cloudflare provides default routing behavior that automatically serves your `/index.html` file for navigation requests (those with `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` headers) which don't match any other asset. For more control over which paths invoke your Worker script, you can use [advanced routing control](#advanced-routing-control).

## Configuration

In order to deploy a Single Page Application to Workers, you must configure the `assets.directory` and `assets.not_found_handling` options in your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#assets):

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"name": "my-worker",
	"compatibility_date": "$today",
	"assets": {
		"directory": "./dist/",
		"not_found_handling": "single-page-application"
	}
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

Configuring `assets.not_found_handling` to `single-page-application` overrides the default serving behavior of Workers for static assets. When an incoming request does not match a file in the `assets.directory`, Workers will serve the contents of the `/index.html` file with a `200 OK` status.

<Render file="navigation_requests" product="workers" />

## Advanced routing control

For more explicit control over SPA routing behavior, you can use `run_worker_first` with an array of route patterns. This approach disables the automatic `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` detection and gives you explicit control over which requests should be handled by your Worker script vs served as static assets.

:::note
Advanced routing control is supported in:

- [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) v4.20.0 and above
- [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/get-started/) v1.7.0 and above
  :::

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"name": "my-worker",
	"compatibility_date": "$today",
	"main": "./src/index.ts",
	"assets": {
		"directory": "./dist/",
		"not_found_handling": "single-page-application",
		"binding": "ASSETS",
		"run_worker_first": ["/api/*", "!/api/docs/*"]
	}
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

This configuration provides explicit routing control without relying on browser navigation headers, making it ideal for complex SPAs that need fine-grained routing behavior. Your Worker script can then handle the matched routes and (optionally using [the assets binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/#binding)) and serve dynamic content.

**For example:**

<TypeScriptExample filename="./src/index.ts">

```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const url = new URL(request.url);

		if (url.pathname === "/api/name") {
			return new Response(JSON.stringify({ name: "Cloudflare" }), {
				headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
			});
		}

		return new Response(null, { status: 404 });
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler;
```

</TypeScriptExample>

## Local Development

If you are using a Vite-powered SPA framework, you might be interested in using our [Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) which offers a Vite-native developer experience.

<Render
	file="static_asset_routing_reference"
	product="workers"
	params={{ not_found_handling: "single-page-application" }}
/>
