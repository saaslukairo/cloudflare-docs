## Background

Secrets are a type of binding that allow you to attach encrypted text values to your Worker. Secrets are used for storing sensitive information like API keys and auth tokens. Secrets are programmatically available on the [`env` parameter](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/#parameters) passed to your Worker's [`fetch` event handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/), and may also be accessible via [`process.env`](/workers/configuration/environment-variables) in Workers that support Node.js compatibility.

## Access your secrets with Workers

Secrets can be accessed from Workers as you would any other [environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/). For instance, given a `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` secret, you can access it in your Worker code:

```js title="index.js"
import postgres from "postgres";

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		const sql = postgres(env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING);

		const result = await sql`SELECT * FROM products;`;

		return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
			headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
		});
	},
};
```

:::note[Secrets Store (beta)]
Secrets described on this page are defined and managed on a per-Worker level. If you want to use account-level secrets, refer to [Secrets Store](/secrets-store/). Account-level secrets are configured on your Worker as a [Secrets Store binding](/secrets-store/integrations/workers/).

## Secrets on deployed Workers

### Adding secrets to your project

#### Via Wrangler

Secrets can be added through [`wrangler secret put`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret) or [`wrangler versions secret put`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-secret-put) commands.

`wrangler secret put` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it immediately.

```sh
npx wrangler secret put <KEY>
```

If using [gradual deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), instead use the `wrangler versions secret put` command. This will only create a new version of the Worker, that can then be deploying using [`wrangler versions deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-deploy).

:::note
Wrangler versions before 3.73.0 require you to specify a `--x-versions` flag.
:::

```sh
npx wrangler versions secret put <KEY>
```

#### Via the dashboard

To add a secret via the dashboard:
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages" />

2. In **Overview**, select your Worker > **Settings**.
3. Under **Variables and Secrets**, select **Add**.
4. Select the type **Secret**, input a **Variable name**, and input its **Value**. This secret will be made available to your Worker but the value will be hidden in Wrangler and the dashboard.
5. (Optional) To add more secrets, select **Add variable**.
6. Select **Deploy** to implement your changes.

### Delete secrets from your project

#### Via Wrangler

Secrets can be deleted through [`wrangler secret delete`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-delete) or [`wrangler versions secret delete`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-secret-delete) commands.

`wrangler secret delete` creates a new version of the Worker and deploys it immediately.

```sh
npx wrangler secret delete <KEY>
```

If using [gradual deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), instead use the `wrangler versions secret delete` command. This will only create a new version of the Worker, that can then be deploying using [`wrangler versions deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#versions-deploy).

```sh
npx wrangler versions secret delete <KEY>
```

#### Via the dashboard

To delete a secret from your Worker project via the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages" />

2. In **Overview**, select your Worker > **Settings**.
3. Under **Variables and Secrets**, select **Edit**.
4. In the **Edit** drawer, select **X** next to the secret you want to delete.
5. Select **Deploy** to implement your changes.
6. (Optional) Instead of using the edit drawer, you can click the delete icon next to the secret.
