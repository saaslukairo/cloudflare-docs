Sending messages from the dashboard allows you to debug Queues or queue consumers without a producer Worker.

To send messages from the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Queues** page.

	 <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers/queues" />

2. Select the queue to send a message to.
3. Select the **Messages** tab.
4. Select **Send**.
5. Choose your message **Content Type**: _Text_ or _JSON_.
5. Enter your message. Alternatively, drag a file over the textbox to upload a file as a message.
6. Select **Send**.

Your message will be sent to the queue.

Refer to the [Get Started guide](/queues/get-started/) to learn how to send messages to a queue from a Worker.
