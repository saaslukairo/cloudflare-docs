## List messages from the dashboard

Listing messages from the dashboard allows you to debug Queues or queue producers without a consumer Worker. Fetching a batch of messages to preview will not acknowledge or retry the message or affect its position in the queue. The queue can still be consumed normally by a consumer Worker.

To list messages in the dashboard:

<Steps>
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Queues** page.

	 <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers/queues" />

2. Select the queue to preview messages from.
3. Select the **Messages** tab.
4. Select **List**.
5. When the list of messages loads, select the blue arrow to the right of each row to expand the message preview.
</Steps>

This will preview a batch of messages currently in the Queue.

## Acknowledge messages from the dashboard

Acknowledging messages from the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) will permanently remove them from the queue, with equivalent behavior as `ack()` in a Worker.

<Steps>
1. Select the checkbox to the left of each row to select the message for acknowledgement, or select the checkbox in the table header to select all messages.
2. Select **Acknowledge messages**.
3. Confirm you want to acknowledge the messages, and select **Acknowledge messages**.
</Steps>

This will remove the selected messages from the queue and prevent consumers from processing them further.

Refer to the [Get Started guide](/queues/get-started/) to learn how to process and acknowledge messages from a queue in a Worker.
