## Benefits

O2O's benefits include applying your own Cloudflare zone's services and settings — such as WAF, Bot Management, Waiting Room, and more — on the traffic destined for your Webflow environment.

## How it works

For more details about how O2O is different than other Cloudflare setups, refer to [How O2O works](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).

## Enable

Webflow customers can enable O2O on any Cloudflare zone plan.

To enable O2O for a specific hostname within a Cloudflare Zone, [create](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) a Proxied `CNAME` or `A` DNS record with your Webflow site name as the target. Webflow's domain addition setup will walk you through other validation steps.

| Type    | Name                 | Target                | Proxy status |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| `CNAME` | `<YOUR_DOMAIN>`      | `cdn.webflow.com`     | Proxied      |
| `A`     | `@`                  | `198.202.211.1`       | Proxied      |

### DNS CAA records

Webflow issues SSL/TLS certificates for merchant domains using Let’s Encrypt and Google Trust Services. If you add any DNS CAA records, you must select **Let’s Encrypt** or **Google Trust Services** as the Certificate Authority (CA) or HTTPS connections may fail.

For more details, refer to [CAA records](/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/#caa-records-added-by-cloudflare).
