## Benefits

O2O routing also enables you to take advantage of Cloudflare zones specifically customized for Shopify traffic.

## How it works

For more details about how O2O is different than other Cloudflare setups, refer to [How O2O works](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).

When you [set up O2O routing for your Shopify website](#enable), Cloudflare enables specific configurations for this SaaS provider. Currently, this includes the following:

- Workers and Snippets are disabled on the `/checkout` URI path.

## Enable

You can enable O2O on any Cloudflare zone plan.

To enable O2O on your account, [create](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) a `CNAME` DNS record.

| Type    | Name                 | Target                | Proxy status |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| `CNAME` | `<YOUR_SHOP_DOMAIN>` | `shops.myshopify.com` | Proxied      |

Once you save the new DNS record, the Cloudflare dashboard will show a Shopify icon next to the CNAME record value. For example:

:::note

For questions about Shopify setup, refer to their [support guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/domains/add-a-domain/connecting-domains/connect-domain-manual).

If you cannot activate your domain using [proxied DNS records](/dns/proxy-status/), reach out to your account team or the [Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com).
