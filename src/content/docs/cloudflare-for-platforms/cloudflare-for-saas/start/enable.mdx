    content: Enable Cloudflare for SaaS

import { DashButton } from "~/components";

To enable Cloudflare for SaaS for your account:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Custom Hostnames** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/custom-hostnames" />

2. Select **Enable**.
3. The next step depends on the zone's plan:
   * **Enterprise**: Can preview this product as a [non-contract service](/billing/preview-services/), which provide full access, free of metered usage fees, limits, and certain other restrictions.
   * **Non-enterprise**: Will have to enter payment information.

Different zone plan levels have access to different features. For more details, refer to [Plans](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/plans/).
