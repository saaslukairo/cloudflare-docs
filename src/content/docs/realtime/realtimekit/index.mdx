Integrate programmable, and easily customizable live video and voice into your web, mobile, and desktop applications with just a few lines of code.

</Description>

The RealtimeKit is a set of user-friendly SDKs and APIs that provides the fastest and simplest way to integrate a complete video and voice call interface into any application, allowing you to get started with just a few lines of code while still offering flexibility for customization.

Powerful yet simple to use, RealtimeKit is built on top of WebRTC and provides a set of user-friendly SDKs and APIs that act as a layer on top of the [Realtime SFU](/realtime/sfu/), so you don't have to handle the complexities of media track management, peer management, and other intricate WebRTC-related tasks.
