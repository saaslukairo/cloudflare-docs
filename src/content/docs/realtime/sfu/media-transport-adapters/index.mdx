Media Transport Adapters bridge WebRTC and other transport protocols. Adapters handle protocol conversion, codec transcoding, and bidirectional media flow between WebRTC sessions and external endpoints.

## What adapters do

Adapters extend Realtime beyond WebRTC-to-WebRTC communication:

- Ingest audio/video from external sources into WebRTC sessions
- Stream WebRTC media to external systems for processing or storage
- Integrate with AI services for transcription, translation, or generation
- Bridge WebRTC applications with legacy communication systems

## Available adapters

### WebSocket adapter (beta)

Stream audio between WebRTC tracks and WebSocket endpoints. Currently in beta; the API may change.

## Architecture

Media Transport Adapters operate as intermediaries between Cloudflare Realtime SFU sessions and external endpoints:

    C <--> D[External Endpoint]
```

### Key concepts

**Adapter instance**: Each connection creates a unique instance with an `adapterId` to manage its lifecycle.

**Location types**:
- `local` (Ingest): Receives media from external endpoints to create new WebRTC tracks
- `remote` (Stream): Sends media from existing WebRTC tracks to external endpoints

**Codec support**: Adapters convert between WebRTC and external system formats.

## Common use cases

### AI processing

- Speech-to-text transcription
- Text-to-speech generation
- Real-time translation
- Audio enhancement

### Media recording

- Cloud recording
- Content delivery networks
- Media processing pipelines

### Legacy integration

- Traditional telephony
- Broadcasting infrastructure
- Custom media servers

## API overview

Media Transport Adapters are managed through the Realtime SFU API:

```
POST /v1/apps/{appId}/adapters/{adapterType}/new
POST /v1/apps/{appId}/adapters/{adapterType}/close
```

Each adapter type has specific configuration requirements and capabilities. Refer to individual adapter documentation for detailed API specifications.

## Best practices

- Close adapter instances when no longer needed
- Implement reconnection logic for network failures
- Choose codecs based on bandwidth and quality requirements
- Secure endpoints with authentication for sensitive media

## Limitations

- Each adapter type has specific codec and format support
- Network latency between Cloudflare edge and external endpoints affects real-time performance
- Maximum message size and streaming modes vary by adapter type
