<Description>

Cloudflare Realtime is a comprehensive suite of products designed to help you build powerful, scalable real-time applications.

</Description>

### RealtimeKit

Cloudflare [RealtimeKit](/realtime/realtimekit/) allows you to integrate programmable and easily customizable live video and voice into your web, mobile, and desktop applications. With just a few lines of code, you can enable live video communication, voice calls, and interactive live streaming.

At its core, RealtimeKit is powered by the [Realtime SFU](/realtime/sfu/), which efficiently routes video and audio streams between participants. RealtimeKit provides a set of user-friendly SDKs and APIs that act as a layer on top of the SFU, so you don't have to handle the complexities of media track management, peer management, and other intricate WebRTC-related tasks.

### Realtime SFU

The [Realtime SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)](/realtime/sfu/) is a powerful media server that efficiently routes video and audio. The Realtime SFU runs on [Cloudflare's global cloud network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) in hundreds of cities worldwide.

For developers with WebRTC expertise, the SFU can be used independently to build highly custom applications that require full control over media streams. This is recommended only for those who want to leverage Cloudflare's network with their own WebRTC logic.

### TURN Service

The [TURN service](/realtime/turn/) is a managed service that acts as a relay for WebRTC traffic. It ensures connectivity for users behind restrictive firewalls or NATs by providing a public relay point for media streams.
