When a [Live Input](/stream/stream-live/start-stream-live/) begins receiving a
broadcast, a new video is automatically created if the input's `mode` property
is set to `automatic`.

To watch, Stream offers a built-in Player or you use a custom player with the
HLS and DASH manifests.

## View by Live Input ID or Video ID

Whether you use the Stream Player or a custom player with a manifest, you can
reference the Live Input ID or a specific Video ID. The main difference is what
happens when a broadcast concludes.

Use a Live Input ID in instances where a player should always show the active
broadcast, if there is one, or a "Stream has not started" message if the input
is idle. This option is best for cases where a page is dedicated to a creator, channel, or
recurring program. The Live Input ID is provisioned for you when you create the
input; it will not change.

Use a Video ID in instances where a player should be used to display a single
broadcast or its recording once the broadcast has concluded. This option is best for cases where
a page is dedicated to a one-time event, specific episode/occurance, or date.
There is a _new_ Video ID generated for each broadcast _when it starts._

Using DVR mode, explained below, there are additional considerations.

Stream's URLs are all templatized for easy generation:

**Stream built-in Player URL format:**

```
https://customer-<CODE>.cloudflarestream.com/<INPUT_ID|VIDEO_ID>/iframe
```

A full embed code can be generated in Dash or with the API.

**HLS Manifest URL format:**

```
https://customer-<CODE>.cloudflarestream.com/<INPUT_ID|VIDEO_ID>/manifest/video.m3u8
```

You can also retrieve the embed code or manifest URLs from Dash or the API.

## Use the dashboard

To get the Stream built-in player embed code or HLS Manifest URL for a custom player:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Live inputs** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/stream/inputs" />

2. Select a live input from the list.
3. Locate the **Embed** and **HLS Manifest URL** beneath the video.
4. Determine which option to use and then select **Click to copy** beneath your choice.

The embed code or manifest URL retrieved in Dash will reference the Live Input ID.

## Use the API

To retrieve the player code or manifest URLs via the API, fetch the Live Input's
list of videos:

```bash title="Request"
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/stream/live_inputs/<LIVE_INPUT_UID>/videos
```

A live input will have multiple videos associated with it, one for each broadcast.
If there is an active broadcast, the first video in the response will have a
`live-inprogress` status. Other videos in the response represent recordings
which can be played on-demand.

Each video in the response, including the active broadcast if there is one,
contains the HLS and DASH URLs and a link to the Stream player. Noteworthy
properties include:

- `preview` -- Link to the Stream player to watch
- `playback`.`hls` -- HLS Manifest
- `playback`.`dash` -- DASH Manifest

In the example below, the state of the live video is `live-inprogress` and the
state for previously recorded video is `ready`.

```json title="Response" {4,7,21,28,32,46}

      },
    }
  ],
}
```

These will reference the Video ID.

## Live input status

You can check whether a live input is currently streaming and what its active
video ID is by making a request to its `lifecycle` endpoint. The Stream player
does this automatically to show a note when the input is idle. Custom players
may require additional support.

```bash
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
https://customer-<CODE>.cloudflarestream.com/<INPUT_ID>/lifecycle
```

In the example below, the response indicates the `ID` is for an input with an active `videoUID`. The `live` status value indicates the input is actively streaming.

```json
{
	"isInput": true,
	"videoUID": "55b9b5ce48c3968c6b514c458959d6a",
	"live": true
}
```

```json
{
	"isInput": true,
	"videoUID": null,
	"live": false
}
```

When viewing a live stream via the live input ID, the `requireSignedURLs` and `allowedOrigins` options in the live input recording settings are used. These settings are independent of the video-level settings.

## Live stream recording playback

After a live stream ends, a recording is automatically generated and available within 60 seconds. To ensure successful video viewing and playback, keep the following in mind:

- If a live stream ends while a viewer is watching, viewers using the Stream player should wait 60 seconds and then reload the player to view the recording of the live stream.
- After a live stream ends, you can check the status of the recording via the API. When the video state is `ready`, you can use one of the manifest URLs to stream the recording.

While the recording of the live stream is generating, the video may report as `not-found` or `not-started`.

If you are not using the Stream player for live stream recordings, refer to [Record and replay live streams](/stream/stream-live/replay-recordings/) for more information on how to replay a live stream recording.
