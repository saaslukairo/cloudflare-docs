You can enable downloads for live stream videos from the Cloudflare dashboard. Videos are available for download after they enter the **Ready** state.

:::note


Downloadable MP4s are only available for live recordings under four hours. Live recordings exceeding four hours can be played at a later time but cannot be downloaded as an MP4.


:::

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Live inputs** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/stream/inputs" />

2. Select a live input from the list.
3. Under **Videos created by live input**, select your video.
4. Under **Settings**, select **Enable MP4 Downloads**.
5. Select **Save**. You will see a progress bar as the video generates a download link.
6. When the download link is ready, under **Download URL**, copy the URL and enter it in a browser to download the video.
