import { Render, DashButton } from "~/components";

<Render file="prereqs_first_start_live_streaming" product="stream" />

Copy the SRT Playback URL for your live input from either:
- The **Live inputs** page of the Cloudflare dashboard.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/stream/inputs" />

- The [Stream API](/stream/stream-live/start-stream-live/#use-the-api)

Paste it into the URL below, replacing `<SRT_PLAYBACK_URL>`:

```sh title="SRT playback with ffplay"
ffplay -analyzeduration 1 -fflags -nobuffer -probesize 32 -sync ext '<SRT_PLAYBACK_URL>'
```
