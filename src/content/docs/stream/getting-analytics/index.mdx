Stream provides server-side analytics that can be used to:

* Identify most viewed video content in your app or platform.
* Identify where content is viewed from and when it is viewed.
* Understand which creators on your platform are publishing the most viewed content, and analyze trends.

You can access data on either:
- The Stream **Analytics** page of the Cloudflare dashboard.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/stream/analytics" />

- The [GraphQL Analytics API](/stream/getting-analytics/fetching-bulk-analytics).

Users will need the **Analytics** permission to access analytics via Dash or GraphQL.
