Page Shield helps manage client-side resources loaded by your website visitors, including scripts, their connections, and [cookies](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/). It can trigger alert notifications when resources change or are considered malicious.

Enabling resource monitoring adds a <GlossaryTooltip term="content security policy (CSP)" link="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy (CSP)</GlossaryTooltip> deployed with a [report-only directive](/page-shield/reference/csp-header/) to collect information from the browser. This allows Cloudflare to provide you with a list of all scripts running on your application and the connections they make to third-party endpoints. Cloudflare also monitors ingress and egress traffic for cookies, either set by origin servers or by the visitor's browser.

The client-side resource monitoring dashboard shows the list of active scripts, connections, and cookies. The **All Reported Scripts** and **All Reported Connections** dashboards show the full list of detected scripts and connections in your domain, respectively, including infrequent and inactive ones.

Cloudflare adds a CSP report-only HTTP header used to monitor webpage resources to a sample of sent responses. This means that there may be a [small delay](/page-shield/troubleshooting/#cloudflare-does-not-show-any-client-side-resources-after-activation) between deploying a script or cookie and having its data displayed in the resource monitoring dashboards.

Enterprise customers with a paid add-on have access to additional classification mechanisms based on threat feeds to determine if a script, or a connection made by a script, is malicious. For more information, refer to [Malicious script and connection detection](/page-shield/how-it-works/malicious-script-detection/).

## Positive security model using policies

Enterprise customers with a paid add-on can create [policies](/page-shield/policies/) to define a positive security model (also known as positive blocking) for resources such as scripts.
