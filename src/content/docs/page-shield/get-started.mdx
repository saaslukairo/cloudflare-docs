## Activate client-side resource monitoring

To enable client-side resource monitoring:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Steps>

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Page Shield**.
3. Select **Enable Page Shield**.

</Steps>

If you do not have access to Page Shield in the Cloudflare dashboard, check if your user has one of the [necessary roles](/page-shield/reference/roles-and-permissions/).

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Security **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings" />

2. (Optional) Filter by **Client-side abuse**.
3. Turn on **Continuous script monitoring**.

</Steps>

If you do not have access to resource monitoring in the Cloudflare dashboard, check if your user has one of the [necessary roles](/page-shield/reference/roles-and-permissions/).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Review detected resources

When you enable client-side resource monitoring, it may take a while to get the list of detected scripts in your domain.

To review the scripts detected by Cloudflare:

<Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

1. Go to the client-side resources page:

   <Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
   2. Go to **Security** > **Page Shield**.

   </TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

   1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Web assets** page.

      <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/web-assets" />

   2. Select the **Client-side resources** tab.

   </TabItem> </Tabs>

2. Review the list of detected scripts, checking for any unknown or unexpected scripts.<br/>
   [Depending on your plan](/page-shield/#availability), Cloudflare will also:
   - Inform you if a script is [considered malicious](/page-shield/how-it-works/malicious-script-detection/).
   - [Show the details](/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/#script-and-connection-details) about each detected script.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

</Steps>

Depending on your plan, you may be able to also review the connections made by scripts in your domain's pages and check them for malicious activity.

## Configure alerts

<Render
	file="alerts-intro"
	product="page-shield"
	params={{
		availabilityDetails:
			"The [available alert types](/page-shield/alerts/alert-types/) depend on your Cloudflare plan.",
	}}
/>

<Render file="alerts-configure" product="page-shield" />

## Define policies

:::note
Only available to Enterprise customers with a paid add-on.
:::

[Policies](/page-shield/policies/) — called content security rules in the [new security dashboard](/security/) — define allowed resources on your websites. Create policies to implement a positive security model[^1].

[^1]: A positive security model is one that defines what is allowed and rejects everything else. In contrast, a negative security model defines what will be rejected and accepts the rest.

### 1. Create a policy with the Log action

When you create a policy with the [_Log_ action](/page-shield/policies/#policy-actions), Cloudflare logs any resources not covered by the policy, without blocking any resources. Use this action to validate a new policy before deploying it.

<Render
	file="policy-create"
	params={{ policyAction: "Log" }}
	product="page-shield"
/>

### 2. Review policy violations

Resources not covered by the policy you created will be reported as [policy violations](/page-shield/policies/violations/). After some time, review the list of policy violations to make sure the policy is correct.

<Render file="policy-review-violations" product="page-shield" />

Update the policy if needed.

### 3. Change policy action to Allow

Once you have verified that your policy is correct, change the policy action from _Log_ to _Allow_.

When you use the [_Allow_ action](/page-shield/policies/#policy-actions), Cloudflare starts blocking any resources not explicitly allowed by the policy.
