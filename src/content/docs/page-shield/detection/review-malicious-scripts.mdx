Cloudflare displays scripts and connections considered malicious at the top of the dashboard lists, so that you can quickly identify those resources, review them, and take action.

## Review malicious scripts

To review the scripts considered malicious:

<Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

1. Go to the client-side resources page:

   <Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
   2. Go to **Security** > **Page Shield**.

   </TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

   1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Web assets** page.

      <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/web-assets" />

   2. Select the **Client-side resources** tab.

   </TabItem> </Tabs>

2. Select the **Scripts** tab.

3. Select **Details** for each script considered malicious. The script details will contain:
   - **Malicious code analysis**: Scores between 1-99 classifying how malicious the current script version is, where 1 means definitely malicious and 99 means definitely not malicious.
   - **Code behavior analysis**: Scores classifying the behavior of the current script version in terms of code obfuscation and data exfiltration. The scores vary between 1-99, where 1 means definitely malicious and 99 means definitely not malicious.
   - **Threat intelligence**: Whether the script URL and/or domain is known to be malicious according to threat intelligence feeds. If the script is considered malicious according to the feeds, the dashboard will show a list of associated threat [categories](/page-shield/how-it-works/malicious-script-detection/#malicious-script-and-connection-categories). If threat intelligence feeds do not have any information about the script URL or domain, the dashboard will show **Not present**.

   The script details also include the last 10 script versions detected by Cloudflare.

4. Based on the displayed information, and with the help of the [last seen/first seen fields in the script details](/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/#view-details), review and update the pages where the malicious script was detected.
