You will receive an invoice in the **Billing** section of your Cloudflare account when you:

* Change your Cloudflare plan type.
* Upgrade or downgrade to or from a paid plan.
* Add a new domain to a Cloudflare account.
* Enable or renew a subscription or add-on service.

For any historical invoices not included in the **Billing** section, [contact Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).

Enterprise customers receive invoices directly from the Cloudflare accounting team.

## Billing cycles

Monthly and annual billing subscriptions run on different billing cycles.

The first monthly purchase on a Cloudflare account sets the billing date for the following monthly subscriptions. The same behaviour occurs for annual subscriptions.

You can have two different billing cycles on your account, one for a monthly subscription and another for an annual subscription.
