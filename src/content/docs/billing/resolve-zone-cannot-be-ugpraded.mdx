When trying to upgrade a domain or purchase a subscription, you may see an error that contains one of the following phrases:

* "this zone cannot be upgraded"
* "there is a problem with your billing profile"
* "The zone you are trying to open a subscription for is banned"

## Causes
* Your account may have an outstanding unpaid balance
* Another account previously associated with the domain / zone your purchase relates to has an outstanding unpaid balance

## Solution
This message appears when the account or domain involved has an outstanding unpaid balance. In the case of a domain, this may also be triggered by a previous account that owned the domain. To resolve this you will need to:

1. Check each Cloudflare account you have access to for an outstanding balance. Refer to [Email address and password](/fundamentals/user-profiles/change-password-or-email/) if you have forgotten these details.
2. Refer to [Pay an overdue balance](/billing/pay-invoices-overdue-balances/#pay-an-overdue-balance) to pay this balance
3. Wait 24 hours after paying this balance
4. Attempt to upgrade again
