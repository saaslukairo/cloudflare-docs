<Description>
Connect your network infrastructure directly to Cloudflare
</Description>

<Plan type="enterprise" />

Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI) allows you to connect your network infrastructure directly to Cloudflare — rather than using the public Internet — for a more performant and secure experience. With CNI, you can bring Cloudflare's full suite of network functions to your network edge.

## Why Use CNI? Key benefits

Enterprises use CNI to achieve:
- **Enhanced Performance**: Gain lower latency and more consistent network throughput.
- **Increased Security**: Reduce your network's attack surface by connecting privately and avoiding the public Internet.

## Connection types

Choose the model that best fits your infrastructure and operational needs.

| | Direct Interconnect | Partner Interconnect | Cloud Interconnect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Port type** | A dedicated physical fiber connection between your network equipment and Cloudflare's hardware in a shared data center. | A virtual connection to Cloudflare established through one of our global connectivity partners. | A private connection between a customer's cloud environments (for example, AWS, Google Cloud) and Cloudflare |
| **Operations** | You are responsible for procuring and managing the physical cross-connect to Cloudflare's equipment. | Your partner manages the connection logistics, often through a software-defined networking portal. | Cloudflare connects to cloud providers' dedicated services, and customers establish private virtual circuits from their virtual private clouds. |
| **Ideal use case** | For customers collocated with Cloudflare who require maximum control, performance, and reliability. | For customers who are not in the same data center as Cloudflare or prefer a managed connectivity solution. | For customers with workloads in public clouds who need secure, reliable connectivity to Cloudflare services. |

## Dataplane

Cloudflare's data centers may support one or more interconnect dataplanes. The dataplane is the type of equipment that terminates your direct connection:
- **Dataplane v1**: A peering connection to a Cloudflare edge data center that supports GRE tunnels for connecting with the Magic Networking overlay, with optional GRE-less delivery for Magic Transit Direct Server Return.
- **Dataplane v2 (beta)**: Is based on the Customer Connectivity Router (CCR), which is specifically designed for customer connectivity. It provides simplified routing without GRE tunneling and supports a 1,500-byte MTU bidirectionally.

When you review the [available locations](/network-interconnect/static/cni-locations-30-10-2025.pdf) (PDF), you can see which dataplane version(s) are available.

### Designing for high availability

To protect against a single point of failure, it is critical to design your CNI deployment for resilience. For business-critical applications, seek Cloudflare locations that support diversity on the device level, which ensures your connections terminate on physically separate hardware.

Refer to [Service Expectations](/network-interconnect/get-started/#service-expectations) for more information.
