You can revoke a client certificate you previously generated with the default [Cloudflare Managed CA](/ssl/client-certificates/).

It is not possible to permanently delete client certificates generated with the default Cloudflare Managed CA. Once revoked, these client certificates will still be listed on the [**Client Certificates**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/client-certificates) page, and can be restored at any time.

## Steps

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Client Certificates** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/client-certificates" />

2. Select the certificate you want to revoke.
3. Select **Revoke** and confirm the operation.

:::caution[Important]


After revoking a certificate, you must update any mTLS rules that check for the presence of a client certificate so that they block all requests that include a revoked certificate.

For more information, refer to [Check for revoked certificates](/api-shield/security/mtls/configure/#check-for-revoked-certificates).
