<FeatureTable id="ssl.csr" />

## Types of CSRs

You can create two types of CSRs:

- **Zone-level**: Meant only for sign certificates associated with the current zone.
- **Account-level**: Meant for organizations that issue certificates across multiple domains.

## Create and use a CSR

To create a CSR:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates" />

2. On **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**, select **Generate**.
3. Choose a **Scope** (only [certain customers](#types-of-csrs) can choose **Account**).
4. Enter relevant information on the form and select **Create**.

To use a CSR:

1. On the [**Edge Certificates**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates) page, select the CSR record you just created under **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**.
2. Copy (or select **Click to copy**) the value for **Certificate Signing Request**.
3. Obtain a certificate from the Certificate Authority (CA) of your choice using your CSR.
4. When you [upload the custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/) to Cloudflare, select an **Encoding mode** of **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** and enter the associated value.

   :::note
   You will not see the option to adjust your **Encoding Mode** until after you have created a CSR associated with the specific zone or your account.
   :::

## Renew a certificate

When you [renew a custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/renewing/), you need to reuse a previously generated CSR.

Note that it is not possible to use a different CSR with the same certificate. In this case, you must upload the certificate as a new certificate, selecting the new CSR.
