HSTS protects HTTPS web servers from downgrade attacks. These attacks redirect web browsers from an HTTPS web server to an attacker-controlled server, allowing bad actors to compromise user data and cookies.

HSTS adds an HTTP header that directs [compliant web browsers](/ssl/reference/browser-compatibility/) to:

- Transform HTTP links to HTTPS links
- Prevent users from bypassing SSL browser warnings

Before enabling HSTS, review the [requirements](#requirements).

:::note

For more background information on HSTS, see the [introductory blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enforce-web-policy-with-hypertext-strict-transport-security-hsts/).

:::

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="ssl.hsts" />

## Requirements

In order for HSTS to work as expected, you need to:

- Have enabled HTTPS before HSTS so browsers can accept your HSTS settings
- Keep HTTPS enabled so visitors can access your site

Once you enabled HSTS, avoid the following actions to ensure visitors can still access your site:

- Changing your DNS records from [Proxied to DNS only](/dns/proxy-status/)
- [Pausing Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/) on your site
- Pointing your nameservers away from Cloudflare
- Redirecting HTTPS to HTTP
- Disabling SSL (invalid or expired certificates or certificates with mismatched hostnames)

:::caution

If you remove HTTPS before disabling HSTS or before waiting for the duration of the original <strong>Max Age Header</strong> specified in your Cloudflare HSTS configuration, your website becomes inaccessible to visitors for the duration of the Max Age Header or until you enable HTTPS.

:::

## Enable HSTS

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To enable HSTS using the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates" />

2. For **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**, select **Enable HSTS**.
3. Read the dialog and select **I understand**.
4. Select **Next**.
5. Configure the [HSTS settings](#configuration-settings).
6. Select **Save**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To enable HSTS with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) request with `security_header` as the setting name in the URI path, and specify the `value` object that includes your HSTS settings.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

:::note

To enable HSTS on a specific subdomain only, configure a [subdomain setup](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/). Alternatively, you can add the appropriate HSTS header at the origin, or use a [response header transform rule](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/).

:::

## Disable HSTS

To disable HSTS on your website:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates" />

2. For **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**, select **Enable HSTS**.
3. Set the **Max Age Header** to **0 (Disable)**.
4. If you previously enabled the **No-Sniff** header and want to remove it, set it to **Off**.
5. Select **Save**.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Preload</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>
				Permits browsers to automatically preload HSTS configuration. Prevents
				an attacker from downgrading a first request from HTTPS to HTTP. Preload

			<td>Off / On</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>No-Sniff Header</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>
				Sends the <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header to prevent
				Internet Explorer and Chrome from automatically detecting a content type
				other than those explicitly specified by the Content-Type header.
			</td>
			<td>Off / On</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

:::note

Once HSTS <strong>Preload</strong> is configured, submit requests for addition to each browser’s preload list. Chrome, Firefox/Mozilla, and Safari use the Chrome preload list. A minimum <strong>Max Age Header</strong> of 12 months is required for inclusion in HSTS preload lists.
