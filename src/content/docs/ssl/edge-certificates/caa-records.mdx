## Who should create CAA records?

You should [create CAA records](#create-caa-records) in Cloudflare if each of the following is true:

- You uploaded your own custom origin server certificate (not provisioned by Cloudflare).
- That certificate was issued by a CA (not self-signed).
- Your domain is on a full setup (not a [CNAME setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup)).
- When adding new [Custom Hostname](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/) and your customer has existing CAA records. In this case, ask your customer to remove the existing CAA records or add the missing CAA record.

## CAA records added by Cloudflare

## Create CAA records

Create a CAA record for each Certificate Authority (CA) that you plan to use for your domain.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To add a CAA record in the dashboard,

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Records** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records" />

2. Select **Add record**.
3. For **Type**, select **CAA**.
4. For **Name**, type your domain.
5. Choose a **Tag**, which specifies the behavior associated with the record.
6. For **CA domain name**, enter the CA name.
7. Select **Save**.
8. Repeat for each CA associated with your domain.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To create a CAA record via the API, use this [POST endpoint](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/create/).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Once you have finished creating all the records, you can review them in the list of records appearing under the DNS Records panel.
