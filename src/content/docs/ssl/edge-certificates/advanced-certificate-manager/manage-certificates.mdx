## Create a certificate

If you are using an existing [Universal SSL certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/), Cloudflare will automatically replace this certificate once you finish ordering your advanced certificate.

Once you order a certificate, you can review the [certificate's status](/ssl/reference/certificate-statuses/) on the [**Edge Certificates**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates) page or via the API with a [GET request](/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate_packs/methods/list/).

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To create a new advanced certificate in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates" />

2. Select **Order Advanced Certificate**.
3. If Cloudflare does not have your billing information, you will need to enter that information.
4. Enter the following information:
   - Certificate authority
   - Certificate hostnames
     - For hostnames longer than 64 characters, use the API.
   - Validation method
   - Certificate validity period
5. Select **Save**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To create a new certificate using the API, send a [POST request](/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate_packs/methods/create/) to the Cloudflare API.

If you need certificates for hostnames longer than 64 characters ([RFC 5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280.html)), set the `cloudflare_branding` option to `true`. This will add `sni.cloudflaressl.com` in the Common Name (CN) field and will include the long hostname as a part of the Subject Alternative Name (SAN).

## Delete a certificate

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To delete an advanced certificate in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Edge Certificates** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates" />

2. Select a certificate.
3. Select **Delete Certificate**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To delete a certificate using the API, send a [DELETE request](/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate_packs/methods/delete/) to the Cloudflare API.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Restart validation

To restart validation for a certificate in a `validation_timed_out` status, send a [PATCH request](/api/resources/ssl/subresources/certificate_packs/methods/edit/) to the API.

## Restrict cipher suites

<Render file="cipher-suites-definition" product="ssl" />

For more details, refer to [Customize cipher suites](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/customize-cipher-suites/).

---

## Perform domain control validation (DCV)

<Render file="dcv-definition" product="ssl" /> <br />

Normally, you only need to update DCV if you have your application on a partial setup (Cloudflare does not run your authoritative nameservers).

For more information about DCV, refer to [DCV methods](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/).

---

## Set up alerts

You can configure alerts to receive notifications for changes in your certificates.

<AvailableNotifications
	product="SSL/TLS"
	notificationFilter="Advanced Certificate Alert"
/>

<Render file="get-started" product="notifications" />

---

## Advanced certificate renewal

The certificate validity period you choose determines when the auto renewal will start for your certificate. For details, refer to [Validity period and renewal](/ssl/reference/certificate-validity-periods/).
