When writing code that interacts with a container instance, you can either use a
[Durable Object directly](/containers/platform-details/durable-object-methods) or use the [`Container` class](https://github.com/cloudflare/containers)
importable from [`@cloudflare/containers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/containers).

We recommend using the `Container` class for most use cases.

<PackageManagers pkg="@cloudflare/containers" />

Then, you can define a class that extends `Container`, and use it in your Worker:

```javascript
import { Container } from "@cloudflare/containers";

class MyContainer extends Container {
	defaultPort = 8080;
	sleepAfter = "5m";
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		// gets default instance and forwards request from outside Worker
		return env.MY_CONTAINER.getByName("hello").fetch(request);
	},
};
```

The `Container` class extends `DurableObject` so all [Durable Object](/durable-objects) functionality is available.
It also provides additional functionality and a nice interface for common container behaviors,
such as:

- sleeping instances after an inactivity timeout
- making requests to specific ports
- running status hooks on startup, stop, or error
- awaiting specific ports before making requests
- setting environment variables and secrets

See the [Containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/cloudflare/containers) for more details
and the complete API.
