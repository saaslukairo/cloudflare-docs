## How rollouts work
When you run `wrangler deploy`, the Worker code is updated immediately and Container
instances are updated using a rolling deploy strategy. The default rollout configuration is two steps,
where the first step updates 10% of the instances, and the second step updates the remaining 90%.
This can be configured in your Wrangler config file using the [`rollout_step_percentage`](/workers/wrangler/configuration#containers) property.

When deploying a change, you can also configure a [`rollout_active_grace_period`](/workers/wrangler/configuration#containers), which is the minimum
number of seconds to wait before an active container instance becomes eligible for updating during a rollout.
At that point, the container will be sent at `SIGTERM`, and still has 15 minutes to shut down gracefully.
If the instance does not stop within 15 minutes, it is forcefully stopped with a `SIGKILL` signal.
If you have cleanup that must occur before a Container instance is stopped, you should do it during this 15 minute period.

Once stopped, the instance is replaced with a new instance running the updated code. Requests may hang while the container is starting up again.

Here is an example configuration that sets a 5 minute grace period and a two step rollout where the first step updates 10% of instances and the second step updates 100% of instances:
<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[containers]]
max_instances = 10
class_name = "MyContainer"
image = "./Dockerfile"
rollout_active_grace_period = 300
rollout_step_percentage = [10, 100]

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "MY_CONTAINER"
class_name = "MyContainer"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = ["MyContainer"]
```
</WranglerConfig>
