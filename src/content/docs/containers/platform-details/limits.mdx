## Instance Types

The memory, vCPU, and disk space for Containers are set through predefined instance types.
Six instance types are currently available:

<Render product="containers" file="instance-types" />

These are specified using the [`instance_type` property](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#containers) in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file. Looking for larger instances? [Give us feedback here](/containers/beta-info/#feedback-wanted) and tell us what size instances you need, and what you want to use them for.

:::note
The `dev` and `standard` instance types are preserved for backward compatibility and are aliases for `lite` and `standard-1`, respectively.

## Limits

While in open beta, the following limits are currently in effect:

| Feature                                                | Workers Paid                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| GiB Memory for all concurrent live Container instances | 400GiB                                         |
| vCPU for all concurrent live Container instances       | 100                                            |
| TB Disk for all concurrent live Container instances    | 2TB                                            |
| Image size                                             | Same as [instance disk space](#instance-types) |
| Total image storage per account                        | 50 GB [^1]                                     |

[^1]: Delete container images with `wrangler containers delete` to free up space. Note that if you delete a container image and then [roll back](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/rollbacks/) your Worker to a previous version, this version may no longer work.
