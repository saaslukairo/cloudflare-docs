<Description>

Enhance your Workers with serverless containers

</Description>

<Plan type="workers-paid" />

Run code written in any programming language, built for any runtime, as part of apps built on [Workers](/workers).

Deploy your container image to Region:Earth without worrying about managing infrastructure - just define your
Worker and `wrangler deploy`.

With Containers you can run:

- Resource-intensive applications that require CPU cores running in parallel, large amounts of memory or disk space
- Applications and libraries that require a full filesystem, specific runtime, or Linux-like environment
- Existing applications and tools that have been distributed as container images

Container instances are spun up on-demand and controlled by code you write in your [Worker](/workers). Instead of chaining together API calls or writing Kubernetes operators, you just write JavaScript:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Worker Code">
		```js
		import { Container, getContainer } from "@cloudflare/containers";

    	export class MyContainer extends Container {
    		defaultPort = 4000; // Port the container is listening on
    		sleepAfter = "10m"; // Stop the instance if requests not sent for 10 minutes
    	}

    	export default {
    		async fetch(request, env) {
    			const { "session-id": sessionId } = await request.json();
    			// Get the container instance for the given session ID
    			const containerInstance = getContainer(env.MY_CONTAINER, sessionId);
    			// Pass the request to the container instance on its default port
    			return containerInstance.fetch(request);
    		},
    	};
    	```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Worker Config">
    	<WranglerConfig>
    		```json
    		{
    			"name": "container-starter",
    			"main": "src/index.js",

## Next Steps

<Feature header="Deploy your first Container" href="/containers/get-started/" cta="Deploy a Container">

Build and push an image, call a Container from a Worker, and understand scaling and routing.

</Feature>

<Feature header="Container Examples" href="/containers/examples/" cta="See Examples">

See examples of how to use a Container with a Worker, including stateless and stateful routing,
regional placement, Workflow and Queue integrations, AI-generated code execution, and short-lived workloads.
