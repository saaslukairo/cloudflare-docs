An IP Access rule can perform one of the following actions:

- **Block**: Prevents a visitor from visiting your site.

- **Allow**: Excludes visitors from all security checks, including [Browser Integrity Check](/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/), [Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/), and the WAF. Use this option when a trusted visitor is being blocked by Cloudflare's default security features. The _Allow_ action takes precedence over the _Block_ action.<br/>Allowing a given country code will not bypass WAF managed rules (previous and new versions). Refer to [Important remarks about allowing/blocking by country](/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/#important-remarks-about-allowingblocking-by-country) for more information.

- **Managed Challenge**: Depending on the characteristics of a request, Cloudflare will dynamically choose the appropriate type of challenge from a list of possible actions. For more information, refer to [Interstitial Challenge Pages](/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/challenge-pages/#managed-challenge-recommended).

- **JavaScript Challenge**: Presents the [Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/) interstitial page to visitors. The visitor or client must support JavaScript. Useful for blocking DDoS attacks with minimal impact to legitimate visitors.

- **Interactive Challenge**: Requires the visitor to complete an interactive challenge before visiting your site. Prevents bots from accessing the site.
