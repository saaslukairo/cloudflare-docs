import { Render } from "~/components";

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to deploy a managed ruleset at the zone level.

Deploy WAF managed rulesets to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase. Other managed rulesets, like DDoS Attack Protection managed rulesets, must be deployed to a different phase. Refer to the specific managed ruleset documentation for details.

The [WAF Managed Rules](/waf/managed-rules/#available-managed-rulesets) page includes the IDs of the different WAF managed rulesets. You will need this information when deploying the rulesets via API.

If you are using Terraform, refer to [WAF Managed Rules configuration using Terraform](/terraform/additional-configurations/waf-managed-rulesets/).

## Example

<Render file="managed-rulesets/api-zone-example" product="waf" />

## Next steps

To customize the behavior of the rules included in a managed ruleset, [create an override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/).

To skip the execution of WAF managed rulesets or some of their rules, [create an exception](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/define-api/) (also called a skip rule).

Exceptions have priority over overrides.
