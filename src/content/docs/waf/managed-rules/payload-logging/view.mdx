   </TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

   1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Analytics** page.

      <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/analytics" />

   2. Select the **Events** tab.

4. Enter your private key in the pop-up window and select **Decrypt**.

   :::note
   The private key is not sent to a Cloudflare server. The decryption occurs entirely in the browser.

</Steps>

If the private key you entered decrypts the encrypted payload successfully, the dashboard will show the name of the fields that matched and the matched string in clear text, along with some text appearing before and after the match.
