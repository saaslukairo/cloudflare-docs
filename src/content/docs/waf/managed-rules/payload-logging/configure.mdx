:::note
Only users with the [Super Administrator role](/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/) can configure payload logging and decrypt payloads in the Cloudflare dashboard. Other users can decrypt payloads if they have access to the logs and to the private key.

<Steps>

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules** tab.

   ![Example Managed Rules configuration in the Managed rules tab under Security > WAF](~/assets/images/waf/waf-managed-rules-tab.png)

3. To configure payload logging for a ruleset you had already deployed in the WAF, select the managed ruleset name.

4. At the bottom of the page, select **Configure payload logging**.

5. After reading and understanding the implications of enabling payload logging, select one of the available options:
   - **Generate key pair using your web browser**: Generates a key pair (a private and a public key) in your browser and configures payload logging with the generated public key.

   - **Use my own public key**: Enter a public key [generated by the `matched-data-cli` command-line tool](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/command-line/generate-key-pair/).

6. Select **Next**.

7. If you generated a key pair in the browser, copy the displayed private key and **store it safely**. You will use this private key later to [view the decrypted payload content](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/view/).

8. Select **Done**.

9. If you are deploying the managed ruleset where you configured payload logging, select **Deploy**. If you configured payload logging for a ruleset you had already deployed, select **Save**.

</Steps>
