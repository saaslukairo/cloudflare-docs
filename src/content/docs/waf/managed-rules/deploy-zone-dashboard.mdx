The instructions on this page will guide you through deploying and configuring a managed ruleset for a zone.

To deploy a managed ruleset for several Enterprise domains in your account, refer to [Deploy a managed ruleset in the dashboard for an account](/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-dashboard/).

## Deploy a managed ruleset

To deploy a managed ruleset with the default configuration:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Steps>

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules** tab.

3. Under **Managed Rulesets**, select **Deploy** next to a managed ruleset.

   ![Example WAF Managed Rules configuration in the Managed rules tab under Security > WAF. There are two managed rulesets already deployed, and one managed ruleset available for deployment.](~/assets/images/waf/waf-managed-rules-tab.png)

</Steps>

This operation deploys the managed ruleset for the current zone, creating a new rule with the _Execute_ action.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Security **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings" />

2. (Optional) Filter by **Web application exploits**.
3. Turn on the managed ruleset(s) you want to deploy:
   - **Cloudflare managed ruleset** - Deploys the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/).
   - **OWASP Core** - Deploys the [Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/).
   - **Sensitive data detection** - Deploys the [Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection](/waf/managed-rules/reference/sensitive-data-detection/) managed ruleset.

</Steps>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

To temporarily turn off a managed ruleset without deleting its deployment configuration, use the toggle next to the rule that deploys the managed ruleset.

## Configure a managed ruleset

Configure a managed ruleset to:

- Specify a custom filter expression to apply the rules in the ruleset to a subset of incoming requests.
- Define specific field values for one or more rules (for example, configure a rule with an action different from the action configured by Cloudflare), or turn off those rules.

To skip one or more rules — or even entire managed rulesets — for specific incoming requests, [add an exception](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/).

:::note
Some managed rulesets may not allow custom configuration, depending on your Cloudflare plan.

### Configure field values for all the rules

To configure rule field values for all the rules in a managed ruleset:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Steps>

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules** tab.

3. Next to the _Execute_ rule deploying the managed ruleset you want to configure, select the managed ruleset name.<br/> If you have not deployed the managed ruleset yet, select the managed ruleset name under **Managed Rulesets**.

4. (Optional) To execute the managed ruleset for a subset of incoming requests, select **Edit scope** and [configure the expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/) that will determine the scope of the current rule deploying the managed ruleset.

5. In the ruleset configuration section, define settings for all the rules in the ruleset by setting one or more fields using the drop-down lists.

   For example, select the action to perform for all the rules in the ruleset from the **Ruleset action** drop-down list.

   ![The Configure Managed Ruleset page displaying the available options to override all the rules in the ruleset. In the displayed managed ruleset you can override the ruleset action.](~/assets/images/waf/waf-configure-ruleset.png)

6. If you are editing a deployed managed ruleset, select **Save**. If you have not deployed the managed ruleset yet, select **Deploy** to deploy the ruleset immediately, or **Save as Draft** to save your deployment settings for later.

</Steps>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security rules** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules" />

3. Search for the managed ruleset you want to configure. Look for a rule with an _Execute_ action.

4. Select the rule name (containing the name of the managed ruleset).

5. (Optional) To execute the managed ruleset for a subset of incoming requests, select **Edit scope** and [configure the expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/) that will determine the scope of the current rule deploying the managed ruleset.

6. In the ruleset configuration section, define settings for all the rules in the ruleset by setting one or more fields using the drop-down lists.

   For example, select the action to perform for all the rules in the ruleset from the **Ruleset action** drop-down list.
