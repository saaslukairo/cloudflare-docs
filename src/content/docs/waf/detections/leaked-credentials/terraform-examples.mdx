import { Render } from "~/components";

The following Terraform configuration examples address common scenarios for managing, configuring, and using leaked credentials detection.

For more information, refer to the [Terraform Cloudflare provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs).

If you are using the Cloudflare API, refer to [Common API calls](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/api-calls/).

## Enable leaked credentials detection

<Render file="detections/leaked-credentials-enable-terraform" product="waf" />

## Configure a custom detection location

<Render
	file="detections/leaked-credentials-configure-location-terraform"
	product="waf"
/>

You only need to provide an expression for the username in custom detection locations.

## Add a custom rule to challenge requests with leaked credentials

This example adds a [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) that challenges requests with leaked credentials by using one of the [leaked credentials fields](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/#leaked-credentials-fields) in the rule expression.

To use the [`cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked/) field you must [enable leaked credentials detection](#enable-leaked-credentials-detection).

<Render file="v4-code-snippets" product="terraform" />

```tf
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "zone_custom_firewall_leaked_creds" {
  zone_id     = "<ZONE_ID>"
  name        = "Phase entry point ruleset for custom rules in my zone"
  description = ""
  kind        = "zone"
  phase       = "http_request_firewall_custom"

  rules {
    ref         = "challenge_leaked_username_password"
    description = "Challenge requests with a leaked username and password"
    expression  = "(cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked)"
    action      = "managed_challenge"
  }
}
```
