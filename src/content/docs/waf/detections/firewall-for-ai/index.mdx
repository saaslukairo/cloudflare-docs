Firewall for AI is a detection that can help protect your services powered by <GlossaryTooltip term="LLM">large language models</GlossaryTooltip> (LLMs) against abuse. This model-agnostic detection currently helps you do the following:

- Prevent data leaks of personally identifiable information (PII) — for example, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.
- Detect and moderate unsafe or harmful prompts – for example, prompts potentially related to violent crimes.
- Detect prompts intentionally designed to subvert the intended behavior of the LLM as specified by the developer – for example, <GlossaryTooltip term="prompt injection">prompt injection</GlossaryTooltip> attacks.

When enabled, the detection runs on incoming traffic, searching for any LLM prompts attempting to exploit the model. Currently, the detection only handles requests with a JSON content type (`application/json`).

Cloudflare will populate the existing [Firewall for AI fields](/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/fields/) based on the scan results. You can check these results in the [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) dashboard by filtering on the `cf-llm` [managed endpoint label](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/) and reviewing the detection results on your traffic. Additionally, you can use these fields in rule expressions ([custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) or [rate limiting rules](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/)) to protect your application against LLM abuse and data leaks.

## Availability

Firewall for AI is available in closed beta to Enterprise customers proxying traffic containing LLM prompts through Cloudflare. Contact your account team to get access.
