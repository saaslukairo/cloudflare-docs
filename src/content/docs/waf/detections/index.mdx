Traffic detections check incoming requests for malicious or potentially malicious activity. Each enabled detection provides one or more scores — available in the [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) dashboard — that you can use in rule expressions.

Cloudflare currently provides the following detections for finding security threats in incoming requests:

<DirectoryListing />

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="security.waf_b_detections" />

For more information on bot score, refer to the [Bots documentation](/bots/concepts/bot-score/).

:::note[Notes]

On Free plans, the leaked credentials detection is enabled by default, and no action is required.

Currently, you cannot manage the [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) and [attack score](/waf/detections/attack-score/) detections from the **Settings** page. Refer to the documentation of each feature for availability details.
