    content: Create a rate limiting rule via API for a zone
---

import { Render, APIRequest } from "~/components";

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to create a rate limiting rule via API at the zone level.

A rate limiting rule is similar to a regular rule handled by the Ruleset Engine, but contains an additional `ratelimit` object with the rate limiting configuration. Refer to [Rate limiting parameters](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/) for more information on this field and its parameters.

You must deploy rate limiting rules to the `http_ratelimit` [phase entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset).

Rate limiting rules must appear at the end of the rules list.

If you are using Terraform, refer to [Rate limiting rules configuration using Terraform](/terraform/additional-configurations/rate-limiting-rules/).

## Create a rate limiting rule

<Render
	file="api-generic-create-rule-procedure"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		ruleType: "rate limiting rule",
		extraObject: "with a `ratelimit` object",
		phaseName: "http_ratelimit",
	}}
/>

### Example A - Rate limiting based on request properties

This example adds a rate limiting rule to the `http_ratelimit` phase entry point ruleset for the zone with ID `$ZONE_ID`. The phase entry point ruleset already exists, with ID `$RULESET_ID`.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		description: "My rate limiting rule",
		expression: '(http.request.uri.path matches "^/api/")',
		action: "block",
		ratelimit: {
			characteristics: [
				"cf.colo.id",
				"ip.src",
				'http.request.headers["x-api-key"]',
			],
			period: 60,
			requests_per_period: 100,
			mitigation_timeout: 600,
		},
	}}
	roles={false}
/>

<Render file="api-create-ruleset-with-rule" product="waf" />

### Example B - Rate limiting with a custom response

This example adds a rate limiting rule to the `http_ratelimit` phase entry point ruleset for the zone with ID `$ZONE_ID`. The phase entry point ruleset already exists, with ID `$RULESET_ID`.

The new rule defines a [custom response](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/create-zone-dashboard/#configure-a-custom-response-for-blocked-requests) for requests blocked due to rate limiting.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		description: "My rate limiting rule",
		expression: '(http.request.uri.path matches "^/api/")',
		action: "block",
		action_parameters: {
			response: {
				status_code: 403,
				content: "You have been rate limited.",
				content_type: "text/plain",
			},
		},
		ratelimit: {
			characteristics: [
				"cf.colo.id",
				"ip.src",
				'http.request.headers["x-api-key"]',
			],
			period: 60,
			requests_per_period: 100,
			mitigation_timeout: 600,
		},
	}}
	code={{
		mark: [{ range: "9-13" }],
	}}
	roles={false}
/>

<Render file="api-create-ruleset-with-rule" product="waf" />

### Example C - Rate limiting ignoring cached assets

This example adds a rate limiting rule to the `http_ratelimit` phase entry point ruleset for the zone with ID `$ZONE_ID`. The phase entry point ruleset already exists, with ID `$RULESET_ID`.

The new rule does not consider requests for cached assets when calculating the rate (`"requests_to_origin": true`).

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		description: "My rate limiting rule",
		expression: '(http.request.uri.path matches "^/api/")',
		action: "block",
		ratelimit: {
			characteristics: [
				"cf.colo.id",
				"ip.src",
				'http.request.headers["x-api-key"]',
			],
			period: 60,
			requests_per_period: 100,
			mitigation_timeout: 600,
			requests_to_origin: true,
		},
	}}
	code={{ mark: [17] }}
	roles={false}
/>

<Render file="api-create-ruleset-with-rule" product="waf" />

### Example D - Complexity-based rate limiting rule

:::note
[Complexity-based rate limiting](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/#complexity-based-rate-limiting) is only available to Enterprise customers with Advanced Rate Limiting.
:::

This example adds a rate limiting rule to the `http_ratelimit` phase entry point ruleset for the zone with ID `$ZONE_ID`. The phase entry point ruleset already exists, with ID `$RULESET_ID`.

The new rule is a complexity-based rate limiting rule that takes the `my-score` HTTP response header into account to calculate a total complexity score for the client. The counter with the total score is updated when there is a match for the rate limiting rule's counting expression (in this case, the same as the rule expression since `counting_expression` is an empty string). When this total score becomes larger than `400` during a period of `60` seconds (one minute), any later client requests will be blocked for a period of `600` seconds (10 minutes).

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		description: "My complexity-based rate limiting rule",
		expression: '(http.request.uri.path wildcard "/graphql/*")',
		action: "block",
		ratelimit: {
			characteristics: ["cf.colo.id", 'http.request.headers["x-api-key"]'],
			score_response_header_name: "my-score",
			score_per_period: 400,
			period: 60,
			mitigation_timeout: 600,
			counting_expression: "",
		},
	}}
	code={{
		mark: [{ range: "13-14" }],
	}}
	roles={false}
/>

## Next steps

Use the different operations in the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to work with the rule you just created. The following table has a list of common tasks for working with rate limiting rules at the zone level:

	product="waf"
	params={{ rulesType: "rate limiting rules", phaseName: "http_ratelimit" }}
