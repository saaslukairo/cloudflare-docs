<Steps>

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and zone.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Rate limiting rules**.

3. To create a new empty rule, select **Create rule**. To duplicate an existing rule, select the three dots next to it > **Duplicate**.

4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

   ![The Create rate limiting rule page in the Cloudflare dashboard](~/assets/images/waf/custom-rules/rate-limiting-create.png)

5. In the **Field** drop-down, choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for **Field** is compared to the value you specify for **Value** using the operator selected in **Operator**.

6. (Optional) Under **Cache status**, disable **Also apply rate limiting to cached assets** to consider only the requests that reach the origin when determining the rate.

7. Under **With the same characteristics**, add one or more [characteristics](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#with-the-same-characteristics) that will define the request counters for rate limiting purposes. Each value combination will have its own counter to determine the rate. For more information, refer to [How Cloudflare determines the request rate](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/).

8. (Optional) To define an expression that specifies the conditions for incrementing the rate counter, enable **Use custom counting expression** and set the expression. By default, the counting expression is the same as the rule expression. The counting expression can include [response fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/?field-category=Response).

9. (Optional) In **When rate exceeds**, select between:
   - **Request based**: Rate limiting based on the number of incoming requests during a given period.
   - **Complexity based**: Rate limiting based on the complexity or cost of handling requests during a given period.

   :::note
   [Complexity-based rate limiting](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/#complexity-based-rate-limiting) is only available to Enterprise customers with Advanced Rate Limiting. Other users will always use request-based rate limiting.
   :::

10. If you selected **Request based** in the previous step (or if you could not select the rate limiting method), enter a value for:
    - **Requests**: Maximum number of requests.
    - **Period**: Time period to consider when determining the rate.

    If you selected **Complexity based**, enter a value for:
    - **Score per period**: Maximum score per period. When this value is exceeded, the rule action will execute.
    - **Period**: Time period to consider when determining the rate.
    - **Response header name**: Name of HTTP header in the response, set by the origin server, with the score for the current request.

11. Under **Then take action**, select the rule action from the **Choose action** drop-down list. For example, selecting _Block_ tells Cloudflare to refuse requests in the conditions you specified when the request limit is reached.

12. (Optional) If you selected the _Block_ action, you can [configure a custom response](#configure-a-custom-response-for-blocked-requests) for requests exceeding the configured rate limit.

13. Select the mitigation timeout in the **Duration** dropdown. This is the time period during which Cloudflare applies the select action once the rate is reached.

    Enterprise customers with a paid add-on can [throttle requests](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#with-the-following-behavior) instead of applying the configured action for a selected duration. To throttle requests, under **With the following behavior** select _Throttle requests over the maximum configured rate_.

14. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

By default, the counting expression is the same as the rule expression. The counting expression can include [response fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/?field-category=Response).

8. Under **When rate exceeds**, define the maximum number of requests and the time period to consider when determining the rate.

9. Under **Then take action**, select the rule action from the **Choose action** drop-down list. For example, selecting _Block_ tells Cloudflare to refuse requests in the conditions you specified when the request limit is reached.
