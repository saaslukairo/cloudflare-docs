1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **Email Routing** > **Settings**. Email Routing will show you the status of your DNS records, such as `Missing`.
3. Select **Enable Email Routing**.
4. The next page will show you what kind of action is needed. For example, if you are missing DNS records, select **Add records and enable**.

If there is a problem with your SPF records, refer to [Troubleshooting SPF records](/email-routing/troubleshooting/email-routing-spf-records/).

:::note[Note]
If you are not using Email Routing but notice an Email Routing DNS record in your zone that you cannot delete, you can use the [Disable Email Routing API call](/api/resources/email_routing/subresources/dns/methods/delete/). It will remove any unexpected records, such as DKIM TXT records like `cf2024-1._domainkey.<hostname>`.
