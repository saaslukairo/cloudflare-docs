import { APIRequest, RuleID } from "~/components";

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to deploy a ruleset. To deploy a ruleset, add a rule with `"action": "execute"` to a [phase entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset), specifying the ruleset ID to execute as an action parameter. Use a separate rule for each ruleset you want to deploy.

A rule that executes a ruleset consists of:

- The ID of the ruleset you want to execute, included in `action_parameters.id`.
- An expression.
- The `execute` action.

The rules in the ruleset execute when a request satisfies the expression.

:::note
To apply a rule to every request in a phase at the zone level, set the rule expression to `true`.
:::

## Example

The following example deploys the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) (with ID <RuleID id="efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee" />) to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase of a given zone (`$ZONE_ID`) by adding a rule that executes the managed ruleset.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/{ruleset_phase}/entrypoint"
	method="PUT"
	parameters={{
		ruleset_phase: "http_request_firewall_managed",
	}}
	json={{
		rules: [
			{
				action: "execute",
				action_parameters: {
					id: "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",
				},
				expression: "true",
				description: "Execute Cloudflare Managed Ruleset on my zone ruleset",
			},
		],
	}}
/>

```json output
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<ZONE_PHASE_RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Zone-level Ruleset 1",
		"description": "",
		"kind": "zone",
		"version": "latest",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "execute",
				"action_parameters": {
					"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",
					"version": "3"
				},
				"expression": "true",
				"description": "Execute Cloudflare Managed Ruleset on my zone ruleset",
				"last_updated": "2021-03-18T18:08:14.003361Z",
				"ref": "<RULE_REF>",
				"enabled": true
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2021-03-18T18:08:14.003361Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

:::caution
This API request replaces any existing rules in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset with a single rule.
