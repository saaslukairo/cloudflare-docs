Follow the steps below to create a rule that executes a managed ruleset and defines an override for rules with a specific tag.

1. [Add a rule](/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/) to a phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset.
2. [Configure a tag override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets a specified action for all rules with a given tag.

## Zone-level example

This example uses the [Update a zone entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to perform the following two steps in a single `PUT` request:

- Set the list of rules in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset to a single rule that executes the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/).
- Override rules with the `wordpress` tag to set the action to `block`. All other rules use the default action provided by the ruleset issuer.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/{ruleset_phase}/entrypoint"
	method="PUT"
	parameters={{
		ruleset_phase: "http_request_firewall_managed",
	}}
	json={{
		rules: [
			{
				action: "execute",
				expression: "true",
				action_parameters: {
					id: "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
					overrides: {
						categories: [
							{
								category: "wordpress",
								action: "block",
							},
						],
					},
				},
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Account-level example

This example uses the [Update an account entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to perform the following two steps in a single `PUT` request:

- Set the list of rules in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset to a single rule that executes the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) for the zone `example.com`.
- Override rules with the `wordpress` tag to set the action to `block`. All other rules use the default action provided by the ruleset issuer.
