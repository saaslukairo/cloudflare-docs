import { Details, APIRequest, Render } from "~/components";

Use a ruleset override and a rule override in a phase entry point ruleset to execute only selected rules in a managed ruleset.

1. [Add a rule](/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/) to a phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset.
2. [Configure a ruleset override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that disables all rules in the managed ruleset.
3. [Configure a rule override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) to set an action for the rules you want to execute.

## Zone-level example

The following `PUT` request uses the [Update a zone entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to define a configuration that executes only two rules from a managed ruleset in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

In this example:

- `"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"` defines the managed ruleset to execute for requests in the specified zone (`$ZONE_ID`).
- `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the managed ruleset.
- `"rules": [{"id": "<RULE_ID_1>", "action": "block", "enabled": true}, {"id": "<RULE_ID_2>", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines a list of overrides at the rule level to enable two individual rules.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/{ruleset_phase}/entrypoint"
	method="PUT"
	parameters={{
		ruleset_phase: "http_request_firewall_managed",
	}}
	json={{
		rules: [
			{
				action: "execute",
				expression: "true",
				action_parameters: {
					id: "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
					overrides: {
						enabled: false,
						rules: [
							{
								id: "<RULE_ID_1>",
								action: "block",
								enabled: true,
							},
							{
								id: "<RULE_ID_2>",
								action: "log",
								enabled: true,
							},
						],
					},
				},
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Account-level example

The following `PUT` request uses the [Update an account entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to define a configuration that executes only two rules from a managed ruleset in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

In this example:

- `"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"` defines the managed ruleset to execute for requests addressed to `example.com`.
- `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the managed ruleset.
- `"rules": [{"id": "<RULE_ID_1>", "action": "block", "enabled": true}, {"id": "<RULE_ID_2>", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines a list of overrides at the rule level to enable two individual rules.
