<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Rules **Overview** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview" />

2. Select **Create rule** > **Configuration Rule**.
3. (Optional) Select one of the rule templates that address common use cases. Then, review and adjust the proposed rule configuration.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
5. Under **When incoming requests match**, select if you wish to apply the rule to all incoming requests or only to requests that match a custom filter expression.
6. (Optional) To define a custom expression, use the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**) or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit expressions in the dashboard](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).
7. Under **Then the settings are**, add the [configuration settings](/rules/configuration-rules/settings/) you wish to change for requests matching the rule expression.
8. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

   <Render file="rules-creation-dash-dns-popup" product="rules" />
