To create Bulk Redirects in the Cloudflare dashboard you must:

<Steps>

1. Create a Bulk Redirect List with one or more URL redirects.
2. Create a Bulk Redirect Rule to enable the URL redirects in the list.

</Steps>

You can create Bulk Redirect Lists and Bulk Redirect Rules in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- At the account level, in **Bulk redirects**.
- At the zone level, go to **Rules** > **Settings** and select the **Bulk Redirects** tab.

However, the lists and rules only exist at the account level and every zone in the same account will show the same items.

<Render
	file="url-forwarding/requires-proxied-site"
	product="rules"
	params={{ forwardingRuleName: "Bulk Redirects" }}
/>
