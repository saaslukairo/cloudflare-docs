import { Example } from "~/components";

In this example the original domain was replaced with a different domain. All functionality was maintained, except for the HTTP service (port 80) which was discontinued.

[Create a redirect rule](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) with the following configuration:

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Wildcard pattern**
  - **Request URL**: `http*://example.com/*`

**Then**

- **Target URL**: `https://example.net/${2}`
- **Status code:** _301_
- **Preserve query string:** Enabled

</Example>

This configuration will perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                               | URL after redirect                        | Status code |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `http://example.com/`                     | `https://example.net/`                    | `301`       |
| `https://example.com/`                    | `https://example.net/`                    | `301`       |
| `https://example.com/my/path/to/page.htm` | `https://example.net/my/path/to/page.htm` | `301`       |
| `https://example.com/search?q=term`       | `https://example.net/search?q=term`       | `301`       |
