import { Example } from "~/components";

In this example, an old website was discontinued and replaced by a new one in a different domain. The functionality is different, and all URLs should now point to the root of the new domain. The same applies to any subdomains of the old domain.

[Create a redirect rule](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) with the following configuration:

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Wildcard pattern**
  - **Request URL**: `http*://*example.com/*`

**Then**

- **Target URL**: `https://example.net/`
- **Status code:** _301_

</Example>

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                               | Target URL             | Status code |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `http://example.com/`                     | `https://example.net/` | `301`       |
| `https://example.com/`                    | `https://example.net/` | `301`       |
| `https://subdomain.example.com/`          | `https://example.net/` | `301`       |
| `https://example.com/my/path/to/page.htm` | `https://example.net/` | `301`       |
| `https://example.com/search?q=term`       | `https://example.net/` | `301`       |
