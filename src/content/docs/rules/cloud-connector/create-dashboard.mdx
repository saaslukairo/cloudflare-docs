To configure a Cloud Connector rule in the dashboard:

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Cloud Connector** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/cloud-connector" />

2. Select your [cloud provider](/rules/cloud-connector/providers/) (Cloudflare R2 or an external provider).

3. If you selected Cloudflare R2 in the previous step, select your bucket and your custom domain, and select **Next**.<br/>
   If you selected a different storage provider, enter the bucket URL and select **Next**.

   :::caution
   The bucket URL must follow a [specific format](/rules/cloud-connector/providers/) according to your provider.
   :::

4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Cloud Connector name**.

5. Under **If**, select **Custom filter expression** and [enter an expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/) to define the traffic that will be redirected to the bucket. For example:
   - To route all requests matching `http*://example.com/images/*` (HTTPS and HTTP requests) you could enter the following expression:<br/>
     `http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://example.com/images/*"`
   - To route all requests matching `http*://images.example.com/*` (HTTPS and HTTP requests) you could enter the following expression:<br/>
     `http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://images.example.com/*"`

   Alternatively, select **All incoming requests** to redirect all incoming traffic for your zone to the storage bucket you selected.

6. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy the rule, select **Save as Draft**.
