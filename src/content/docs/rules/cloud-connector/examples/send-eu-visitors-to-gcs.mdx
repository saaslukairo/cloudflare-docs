To route requests from visitors in the European Union to a Google Cloud Storage bucket:

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Cloud Connector** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/cloud-connector" />

2. Select **Google Cloud Storage** as your [cloud provider](/rules/cloud-connector/providers/).
3. Enter the bucket URL. You can structure the URL in two ways:
   - **Subdomain-style URL**: For `<BUCKET_NAME>.storage.googleapis.com`, your files should be organized in the root of the bucket. For example, `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/index.html` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.storage.googleapis.com/index.html`.
   - **URI path-style URL**: If you set the hostname to `storage.googleapis.com`, your bucket must include folders corresponding to the intended URI paths. For example, if you want `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/eu/index.html` to map to a file in your bucket, the file should be placed at `https://storage.googleapis.com/<BUCKET_NAME>/eu/index.html`.
4. (Optional) Use [URL Rewrite Rules](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/) to adjust the URL structure. For example, you can [create a URL rewrite](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/) that changes `/eu` to `/<BUCKET_NAME>` to match the URI path-style URL structure.
5. (Optional) Use [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) to adjust the caching behavior for objects returned from the bucket. For example, you can [create a cache rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/) that caches every returned object matching the `/eu` URI path for seven days (defined through the **Edge TTL** setting).
6. Select **Next** and enter a descriptive name like `Route EU visitors to GCP` in **Cloud Connector name**.
7. Under **If**, select **Custom filter expression** and enter the following expression:
   `(ip.src.is_in_european_union)`<br />
   This expression targets traffic from European Union users.
8. Select **Deploy** to activate the rule.

</Steps>

This configuration will route traffic from EU visitors to your Google Cloud Storage bucket. Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
