## Create a page rule

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To create a page rule in the dashboard:

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Page Rules** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/page-rules" />

2. Select **Create Page Rule**.
3. For **URL**, enter the URL or URL pattern that should match the rule ([more details about wildcard matching](/rules/page-rules/reference/wildcard-matching/)).
4. For **Pick a Setting**, select a [Cloudflare setting](/rules/page-rules/reference/settings/) to adjust. If desired, select **Add a Setting** to adjust multiple Cloudflare settings with the same rule.
5. In the **Order** dropdown, specify the desired order: _First, Last_ or _Custom_.
6. To save and deploy your rule, select **Save and Deploy Page Rule**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

</Steps>

For ideas about what rules you can create, refer to [recommended rules](/rules/page-rules/reference/recommended-rules/).

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To create a page rule using the API, send a [`POST` request](/api/resources/page_rules/methods/create/).

You may also want to review the documentation on [wildcard matching](/rules/page-rules/reference/wildcard-matching/), [available settings](/rules/page-rules/reference/settings/), and [recommended rules](/rules/page-rules/reference/recommended-rules/).

:::note[Notes]

- Page Rules require a [proxied DNS record](/dns/proxy-status/) to work. Page Rules will not apply to subdomains that do not exist in DNS or are not being directed to Cloudflare.

- Cloudflare does not support non-ASCII characters — such as punycode/unicode domain — in Page Rules. Instead, you could URL-encode the string using [Punycode converter](https://www.punycoder.com/).
