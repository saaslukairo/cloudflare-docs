import { Example, Steps, DashButton } from "~/components";

This tutorial will instruct you how to modify both the URI path and the `Host` header of incoming requests using [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/) and Origin Rules.

Your website visitors will be routed from `https://<YOUR_SOURCE_HOSTNAME>/uploads/*` to `https://<YOUR_TARGET_HOSTNAME>/*`.

In this tutorial you will do the following:

1. Create a URL rewrite to remove `/uploads` from the path.
2. Create an origin rule to modify the `Host` header to desired hostname.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage both URI paths and `Host` headers to route traffic appropriately and optimize request handling.

## 1. Create a URL rewrite

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Rules **Overview** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview" />

2. Select **Create rule** > **URL Rewrite Rule**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
4. Under **If incoming requests match**, select **Custom filter expression**, select **Edit expression**, and enter the following expression:

   <Example>

   Text in **Expression Editor**:

   ```txt
   raw.http.request.uri.path matches "^/uploads/.*"
   ```

   </Example>

5. Under **Set Rewrite parameters**, select **Path** > **Rewrite to**, and select _Dynamic_.

6. Define the action for your rewrite URL rule:

   <Example>

   Text after **Path** > **Rewrite to** > _Dynamic_:

   ```txt
   regex_replace(raw.http.request.uri.path, "^/uploads/", "/")
   ```

   </Example>

   The [`regex_replace()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#regex_replace) function replaces the `/uploads/` part of the path with `/`, changing `/uploads/example.jpg` to `/example.jpg`.

7. Select **Deploy**.

</Steps>

## 2. Create an origin rule

:::note
If you are routing traffic to an object storage bucket, use [Cloud Connector](/rules/cloud-connector/) instead of an origin rule.
:::

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Rules **Overview** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview" />

2. Select **Create rule** > **Origin Rule**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
4. Under **When incoming requests match**, define the rule expression:

   <Example>

   Text in **Expression Editor**:

   ```txt
   raw.http.request.uri.path matches "^/uploads/.*"
   ```

   </Example>

5. Under **Set origin parameters**, select **Host Header** > **Rewrite to**.

6. Configure the rule to modify the `Host` header to desired hostname:

   <Example>

   Text after **Host Header** > **Rewrite to**:

   ```txt
   example.com
   ```

   </Example>

   This will set the [`Host` header](/rules/origin-rules/features/#host-header) to `example.com` for matching requests. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your actual hostname.

7. (Optional) To route requests to a different origin (DNS target), use [DNS override](/rules/origin-rules/features/#dns-record):

   <Example>

   Text after **DNS Record** > **Override to**:

   ```txt
   example.com
   ```

   </Example>

   This will route requests to the DNS target of `example.com` instead of your default [DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

8. Select **Deploy**.

</Steps>

## Final remarks

After completing this tutorial, incoming traffic for `https://<YOUR_SOURCE_HOSTNAME>/uploads/*` will be routed to `https://<YOUR_TARGET_HOSTNAME>/*`.

Ensure the filters for the [URL rewrite](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/) and the [origin rule](/rules/origin-rules/) (or [Cloud Connector](/rules/cloud-connector/) rule) are precise to avoid unintended rule executions.

Remember that rules are evaluated [in sequence](/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/), so Transform Rules (including URL rewrites) run before Origin Rules or Cloud Connector.
