import { Example } from "~/components";

To rewrite everything under `/blog/<PATH>` to `/marketing/<PATH>`, create a new URL rewrite rule and define a dynamic URL path rewrite using [wildcard pattern parameters](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/#wildcard-pattern-parameters):

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Wildcard pattern**
  - **Request URL**: `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/blog/*`

**Then rewrite the path and/or query**

- **Target path**: [`/`] `blog/*`
- **Rewrite to**: [`/`] `marketing/${1}`

</Example>

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
