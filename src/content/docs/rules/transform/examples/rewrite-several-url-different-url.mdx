import { Example } from "~/components";

To rewrite paths like `/images/<FOLDER1>/<FOLDER2>/<FILENAME>` — where `<FOLDER1>`, `<FOLDER2>`, and `<FILENAME>` can vary — to `/img/<FILENAME>`, create a URL rewrite rule with a dynamic rewrite of the path component:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
http.request.uri.path ~ "^/images/[^/]+/[^/]+/[^/]+$"
```

Text after **Path** > **Rewrite to** > _Dynamic_:

```txt
regex_replace(http.request.uri.path, "^/images/[^/]+/[^/]+/(.+)$", "/img/${1}")
```

</Example>

For example, this rule would rewrite the `/images/nature/animals/tiger.png` path to `/img/tiger.png`.
