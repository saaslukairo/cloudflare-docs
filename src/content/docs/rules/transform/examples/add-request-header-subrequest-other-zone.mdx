import { Example } from "~/components";

The following request header transform rule adds an HTTP header to Workers subrequests coming from a different zone:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor** (replace `myappexample.com` with your domain):

```txt
(cf.worker.upstream_zone != "" and cf.worker.upstream_zone != "myappexample.com")
```

Selected operation under **Modify request header**: _Set static_

**Header name**: `X-External-Workers-Subrequest`

**Value**: `1`

</Example>

The [`cf.worker.upstream_zone`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.worker.upstream_zone/) field used in the rule expression is set to empty if the current request is not a Workers subrequest.
