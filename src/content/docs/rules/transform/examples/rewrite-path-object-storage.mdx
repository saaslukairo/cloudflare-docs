  requests for `/files/...` URI paths to `/...`.

import { Example } from "~/components";

To remove `/files/` from URI paths before routing request to your object storage bucket, create a new URL rewrite rule and define a dynamic URL path rewrite using [wildcard pattern parameters](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/#wildcard-pattern-parameters):

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Wildcard pattern**
  - **Request URL**: `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/files/*`

**Then rewrite the path and/or query**

- **Target path**: [`/`] `files/*`
- **Rewrite to**: [`/`] `${1}`

</Example>

Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
Then, use [Cloud Connector](/rules/cloud-connector/) to route traffic to an object storage bucket.
