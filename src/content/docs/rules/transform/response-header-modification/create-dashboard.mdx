Refer to the [Rules examples gallery](/rules/transform/examples/?operation=Response+modification) for examples of rule definitions.

To create a rule:

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Rules **Overview** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview" />

2. Select **Create rule** > **Response Header Transform Rule**.

3. (Optional) Select one of the rule templates that address common use cases. Then, review and adjust the proposed rule configuration.

4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

5. Under **When incoming requests match**, select if you wish to apply the rule to all incoming requests or only to requests that match a custom filter expression.

6. (Optional) To define a custom expression, use the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**) or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit expressions in the dashboard](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).

   :::note
   Check the [available fields and functions](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/reference/fields-functions/).

7. For **Modify response header**, select one of the following operations:
   - _Add static_ — Adds an HTTP response header with a static string value. This operation will not remove any existing response headers with the same name.
   - _Add dynamic_ — Adds an HTTP response header according to the provided expression. This operation will not remove any existing response headers with the same name.
   - _Set static_ — Sets the value of an HTTP response header to a static string value. Overrides the value of any existing headers with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
   - _Set dynamic_ — Sets the value of an HTTP response header according to the provided expression. Overrides the value of any existing headers with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
   - _Remove_ — Removes the HTTP response header with the provided name, if it exists.

8. Enter the name of the HTTP response header to modify in **Header name** and the static value or expression in **Value**, if you are setting the header value.

9. To modify another HTTP response header in the same rule, select **Set new header**. You can modify up to 30 HTTP response headers in a single rule.

   The following example includes the modification of three response headers:

10. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.
