    content: Configure Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection in the dashboard
---

import { Render } from "~/components";

Configure the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset by defining [overrides](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) in the Cloudflare dashboard. DDoS overrides allow you to customize the **action** and **sensitivity** of one or more rules in the managed ruleset.

You define overrides for the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset at the account level.

For more information on the available parameters and allowed values, refer to [Ruleset parameters](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/network/override-parameters/).

## Create a DDoS override

<Render file="managed-rulesets/create-override" product="ddos-protection" />

<Render
	file="managed-rulesets/delete-override"
	product="ddos-protection"
	params={{
		one: "select your account",
		two: "Account Home > L3/4 DDoS > Network-layer DDoS Protection",
	}}
/>
