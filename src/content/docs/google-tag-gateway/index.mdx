Google tag gateway for advertisers allows website owners using Cloudflare as a CDN to get the most out of ad measurement tools with just a few clicks. It allows you to deploy Google scripts using your own domain, enhancing data privacy and improving signal measurement recovery. Unlike standard setups where tags are requested from a Google domain, Google tag gateway for advertisers loads the tag from your domain and sends measurement events to your domain, where they are forwarded to Google.

Learn more about why we built it and how it works in our [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/google-tag-gateway-for-advertisers/).

## Get started

Site owners can enable this feature in one of two ways: through the Google tag console, or through the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/tag-management/google-tag-gateway).

### Configure in Google Tag Manager
The fastest way to set up Google tag gateway for advertisers is in Google Tag Manager. [Follow the steps in Google's Help Center](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/16061641).

### Configure in the Cloudflare dashboard

:::note
Your Cloudflare dashboard user must have one of the following [Account Roles](/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/#account-scoped-roles): Super Administrator, Administrator or Zaraz Admin. If you are using Domain Scoped Roles, your [Domain Role](/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/#domain-scoped-roles) must be Domain Administrator.
:::

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Google Tag Gateway** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/tag-management/google-tag-gateway" />

2. Select your domain.
4. Enable the toggle for **Turn on and configure Google tag gateway**.

5. Add your Google tag ID and the path on your website reserved for the Google tag.
The [Google tag ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9539598?hl=en) can be found in the Google Tag Experience dashboard. The measurement path is an unused path on your site that will load Google Tag Manager and all subsequent measurement requests.

6. Once you click **Save**, Google tag gateway for advertisers will be enabled on your zone. If you already have a GTM script on your website, this First Party Tag will override the existing script.

Now that you have authenticated into your Cloudflare account and configured GTM in first-party mode, your Google Tags will be loaded using `https://your-domain/measurement-path/...`and subsequent measurement requests will be served by Cloudflare.
