  Cloudflare allows users to use their Cloudflare prefix to route traffic to a different service. Service bindings must be created on the parent account of the prefix.

With [service bindings](/byoip/service-bindings/), CDN[^1] customers using BYOIP can take the same prefix they have onboarded to Cloudflare and use it to selectively route traffic on a per-IP address basis to [Spectrum](/spectrum/)[^2], or vice versa. This means:

- You can upgrade individual IPs within a CDN prefix to a Spectrum IP. For example, if you have a CDN prefix 203.0.113.0/24, you can upgrade 203.0.113.1 to Spectrum.

- You can upgrade individual IPs within a Spectrum prefix to a CDN IP. For example, if you have a Spectrum prefix 203.0.113.0/24, you can upgrade 203.0.113.1 to CDN.

This guide will use the first example and consider a prefix that was onboarded to the CDN, with a few IPs upgraded to Spectrum.

## Before you begin

<Render
	file="service-bindings-prereqs"
	product="byoip"
	params={{
		pre_existing_product: "CDN",
		added_product: "Spectrum",
	}}
/>

---

## Prepare your IPs

### 1. Get account information

<Render
	file="service-bindings-account-info"
	product="byoip"
	params={{
		pre_existing_product: "CDN",
		added_product: "Spectrum",
	}}
/>

### 2. Create service bindings

<Render
	file="service-bindings-create-binding"
	product="byoip"
	params={{
		pre_existing_product: "CDN",
		added_product: "Spectrum",
	}}
/>

### 3. Verify all service bindings

After the propagation time (four to six hours), the [List Service Bindings](/api/resources/addressing/subresources/prefixes/subresources/service_bindings/methods/get/) endpoint should return all service bindings that are part of the prefix - in this case, CDN and Spectrum.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/addressing/prefixes/{prefix_id}/bindings"
	method="GET"
/>

## Set up your Cloudflare services

### CDN

If you already use BYOIP with CDN, you might be able to skip this step. However, if you are using this guide to upgrade a few IPs from a Spectrum prefix to the CDN, consider the following sections on [address maps](#address-maps) and [DNS records](#dns-records).

:::note
As described below, address maps and DNS records do not apply to Spectrum. To set up your Spectrum application with BYOIP, refer to [Spectrum](#spectrum).
:::

#### Address maps

Use <GlossaryTooltip term="address map" link="/byoip/address-maps/">address maps</GlossaryTooltip> to specify which IPs should be used by Cloudflare in DNS responses when a record is <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status" link="/dns/proxy-status/">proxied</GlossaryTooltip>.

You can choose between two different scopes:

- Account-level: uses the address map for all proxied DNS records across all of the zones within an account.
- Zone-level: uses the address map for all proxied DNS records within a zone.

:::note
If you need to map only specific subdomains (and not all proxied DNS records) to specific IP addresses, you can use a [Subdomain setup](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/).
:::

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI">
<TabItem label="Dashboard" no-code="true">

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Address Maps** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/ip-addresses/proxy-ips" />

2. Select **Create an address map**.
3. Choose the scope of the address map.
4. Add the zones and IP addresses that you want to map.
5. Name your address map.
6. Review the information and select **Save and Deploy**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="API" no-code="true">

Use the [Create Address Map](/api/resources/addressing/subresources/address_maps/methods/create/) endpoint.

Make sure you have the correct Key/Token and permissions.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### DNS records

While the DNS record proxy status and address map will determine how Cloudflare's authoritative DNS responds to requests for your hostnames, the IP addresses specified in `A`/`AAAA` records will determine [how Cloudflare reaches the configured origin](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#how-cloudflare-works-as-a-reverse-proxy).

:::note
As you create the necessary DNS records, [Total TLS](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/total-tls/) can help making sure that you have SSL/TLS certificates in place for all your hostnames.
:::

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI">
<TabItem label="Dashboard" no-code="true">

To create a DNS record in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Records** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records" />

2.  Select **Add record**.
3.  Choose an address (`A`/`AAAA`) [record type](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/).
4.  Complete the required fields, setting the **Proxy status** to **proxied**.
5.  Select **Save**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="API" no-code="true">

To create records with the API, use a [POST request](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/create/). For field definitions, select a record type under the request body specification.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Details header="Example">

| Type | Name  | IP address      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `A`  | `www` | `203.0.113.150` | `Proxied`    | `Auto` |

At this point, if an address map for a zone `example.com` specifies that Cloudflare should use `203.0.113.100` for proxied records and the above record exists in the same zone, you can expect the following:

1. Cloudflare responds to DNS requests for `www.example.com` with `203.0.113.100`.
2. Cloudflare proxies requests through the CDN and then routes the requests to the origin server `203.0.113.150`.
3. As the HTTP response egresses the Cloudflare network back to the client side, the source IP address of the response becomes `203.0.113.100` (the IP address that the HTTP request originally landed on).

</Details>

:::note
Having the same IP address as ingress IP (defined in the address map) and origin IP (listed in the DNS record) will not cause any loops.
:::

<Details header="Example">

Assuming `203.0.113.100` was also the origin IP, the DNS record would look like the following:

| Type | Name  | IP address      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `A`  | `www` | `203.0.113.100` | `Proxied`    | `Auto` |

</Details>

### Spectrum

Configuring Spectrum to use your own IP address is only possible via the [Cloudflare API](/api/resources/spectrum/).

The `origin_direct` field takes the origin IP address, while `edge_ips` allows you to define which IP address from your BYOIP prefix Cloudflare should use to process requests for your Spectrum application.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/apps"
	method="POST"
	json={[
		{
			protocol: "tcp/22",
			dns: {
				type: "CNAME",
				name: "ssh.example.com",
			},
			origin_direct: ["tcp://192.0.2.1:22"],
			proxy_protocol: "off",
			ip_firewall: true,
			tls: "full",
			edge_ips: {
				type: "static",
				ips: ["203.0.113.18"],
			},
			traffic_type: "direct",
		},
	]}
	code={{
		mark: [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, "203.0.113.18"],
	}}
/>
