Development Mode temporarily suspends Cloudflare's edge caching and [Polish](/images/polish/) features for three hours unless disabled beforehand. Development Mode allows customers to immediately observe changes to their cacheable content like images, CSS, or JavaScript.

:::note

To bypass cache for longer than three hours, use bypass cache in [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#bypass-cache).

## Enable Development Mode

Development Mode temporarily bypasses Cloudflare's cache and does not purge cached files. To instantly purge your Cloudflare cache, refer to [purge cache](/cache/how-to/purge-cache/).

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Configuration** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/caching/configuration" />

2. Toggle **Development Mode** to **On**.
