## Change environment version

To prevent accidental changes, you can only update an environment's version through the process of **Promotion** or **Roll back**.

For more details on the flow of versions and environments, refer to [How it works](/version-management/about/).

### Promote a version

Promotion moves a version from a lower-ranked environment to the next highest one.

### Roll back a version

When you roll back a version, you revert the environment to the previous version assigned to it.

To roll back a version:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Account home** page and select your account and zone.

    <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/home" />

2. Go to **Version Management**.
3. Select **Environments**.
4. On a specific environment, select **Roll back**.

***
