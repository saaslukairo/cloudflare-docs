With [outgoing zone transfers](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-primary/), you can keep Cloudflare as your primary DNS provider and use one or more secondary providers for increased availability and fault tolerance.

## Before you begin

Make sure your account team has enabled your zone for outgoing zone transfers.

Consider the [expected behaviors](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-primary/transfer-criteria/) for different record types, and review your [existing DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) to make sure all of them have the desired **Proxy status**.

If using the API, you may also want to [locate your Zone and Account IDs](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).

---

## 1. Create TSIG (optional)

<Render file="tsig-definition" product="dns" />

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="tsig-create-dash" product="dns" />

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="tsig-create-api" product="dns" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 2. Create Peer DNS Server (optional)

You only need to create a peer DNS server if you want:

- Your secondary nameservers to receive **NOTIFYs** for changes to your Cloudflare DNS records.
- A **TSIG** to sign zone transfer requests and **NOTIFYs**.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To create a peer using the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the account **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/configurations" />

2. Go to **DNS Settings**.
3. Under **DNS Zone Transfers**, for **Peer DNS servers**, select **Create**.
4. Enter the following information, paying particular attention to:
   - **IP**: If configured, specifies where Cloudflare sends NOTIFY requests to.
   - **Port**: Specifies the IP Port for the NOTIFY IP.
   - **Enable incremental (IXFR) zone transfers**: Does not apply when you are using Cloudflare as your primary DNS provider (Cloudflare zones always accept IXFR requests).
   - **Link an existing TSIG**: If desired, link the TSIG you [previously created](#1-create-tsig-optional).
5. Select **Create**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To create a peer DNS server using the API, send a [POST](/api/resources/dns/subresources/zone_transfers/subresources/peers/methods/create/) request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 3. Link peer to primary zone (optional)

If you previously [created a peer DNS server](#2-create-peer-dns-server-optional), you should link it to your primary zone.

:::note

<Render file="linked-peers-limit" product="dns" />
:::

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To link a primary zone to a peer using the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings" />

2. For **DNS Zone Transfers**, select **Manage linked peers**.
3. Select a peer.
4. Select **Save**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To link a primary zone to a peer using the API, send a [POST](/api/resources/dns/subresources/zone_transfers/subresources/incoming/methods/create/) request with the ID of the peer you [previously created](#2-create-peer-dns-server-optional).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

:::caution[Multiple peers and TSIG]
If you link more than one peer to a zone and at least one of them has TSIG configured, all peers are expected to also use the same TSIG.
:::

## 4. Update your secondary DNS provider

Your secondary DNS provider should send zone transfer requests (via AXFR or IXFR) to [this IP](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/access-control-lists/cloudflare-ip-addresses/#transfer-ip) on port 53 and from the IP address specified in your [peer configuration](#2-create-peer-dns-server-optional).

It should also have updated [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/access-control-lists/cloudflare-ip-addresses/#allow-range) to prevent NOTIFY messages sent from Cloudflare IP ranges from being blocked.

## 5. Add secondary nameservers within Cloudflare

Using the information from your secondary DNS provider, [create NS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) on your zone apex listing your secondary nameservers.

By default, Cloudflare ignores NS records added to the zone apex. To modify this behavior, enable [multi-provider DNS](/dns/nameservers/nameserver-options/#multi-provider-dns).

:::note
If your account [zone defaults](/dns/additional-options/dns-zone-defaults/) are already defined to have **Multi-provider DNS** enabled, this step may not be necessary.
:::

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">


1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings" />

2. Enable **Multi-provider DNS**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Send the following `PATCH` request replacing the placeholders with your zone ID and authentication information:

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/dns_settings"
	method="PATCH"
	json={{
		multi_provider: true,
	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

:::note
In case you want to keep Cloudflare as the only authoritative DNS provider, do not enable multi-provider DNS. In this way, your secondary DNS is kept hidden and up-to-date with the Cloudflare primary, as a backup option for disaster recovery scenarios.
:::

## 6. Enable outgoing zone transfers

When you enable outgoing zone transfers, this will send a DNS NOTIFY message to your secondary DNS provider.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings" />

2. For **Outgoing Zone Transfers**, switch the toggle to **On**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To enable outgoing zone transfers using the API, send a [POST](/api/resources/dns/subresources/zone_transfers/subresources/outgoing/methods/enable/) request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 7. Add secondary nameservers to registrar

At your registrar, add the nameservers of your secondary DNS provider.
