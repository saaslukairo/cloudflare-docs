Consider the sections below to understand the expected behaviors, depending on DNS record type and proxied status.


## Proxied records

For each [proxied DNS record](/dns/proxy-status/) in your zone, Cloudflare will transfer out two `A` and two `AAAA` records.

These records correspond to the [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) used for proxying traffic.

## DNS-only CNAME records

As explained in [DNS record types](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#cname), Cloudflare uses a process called [CNAME flattening](/dns/cname-flattening/) to return the final IP address instead of the CNAME target. CNAME flattening improves performance and is also what allows you to set a CNAME record on the zone apex.

Depending on the [settings](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/) you have, when you use DNS-only CNAME records with outgoing zone transfers, you can expect the following:

- For DNS-only CNAME records on the zone apex, Cloudflare will always transfer out the flattened IP addresses.
- For DNS-only CNAME records on subdomains, Cloudflare will only transfer out flattened IP addresses if the setting [**CNAME flattening for all CNAME records**](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#for-all-cname-records) is enabled.

:::note[Per-record CNAME flattening]

For records using [per-record CNAME flattening](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#per-record) (meaning **CNAME flattening for all CNAME records** is disabled), Cloudflare will transfer out the CNAME, not the flattened IP address.

:::

## Records that are not transferred

The following records are not transferred out when you use Cloudflare as primary:

- [CAA records](/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/)
- TXT records used for TLS certificate validation
- DNS-only [Load Balancing](/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/) records

:::note
Proxied Load Balancing records are transferred as explained in [Proxied records](#proxied-records).
