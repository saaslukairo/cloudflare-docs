As opposed to the [normal process](/dns/dnssec/) for enabling DNSSEC, DNSSEC with a subdomain setup requires a few additional steps.

## Requirements

To use DNSSEC for a subdomain setup, DNSSEC must be enabled on the parent zone. After enabling DNSSEC on the parent zone, you should wait the minimum <GlossaryTooltip term="time-to-live (TTL)">TTL</GlossaryTooltip> value (specified in the [SOA record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-soa-record/) of the parent zone) to ensure DNS resolvers provide the same DNS query responses.

## Setup

1. [Create](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/#how-to) the child zone.

2. Make sure the child zone is [active](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) on Cloudflare and that DNS resolution is working properly for your subdomain.

3. [Enable DNSSEC](/dns/dnssec/) for the child zone and save the information provided within the DS record output.

4. On the [**DNS Records**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page of the parent zone, [add the DS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) from the previous step.

5. Add an A record to the child zone to validate DNS resolution.

6. Wait two to six hours. Then, [test the A record](/dns/dnssec/troubleshooting/#test-dnssec-with-dig) added in the previous step using multiple DNS resolvers with DNSSEC validation (`1.1.1.1`, `8.8.8.8`, and `9.9.9.9`). For example, if the A record is for `test.child.example.com`: `dig test.child.example.com +dnssec @1.1.1.1`.
