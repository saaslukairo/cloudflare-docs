:::note
A wildcard record (`*.example.local`) in the matching internal zone will take precedence over an exact match in a reference zone.
:::

## Configuration conditions

- Each internal zone can only reference one other zone.
- The same zone can be referenced by multiple internal zones.
- Public zones cannot be used as reference zones.
- Reference zones do not have to be linked to the same [DNS view](/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/) as the zone referencing them. They may also not be linked to any view at all.

## Set up

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Internal DNS** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/internal-dns" />

2. Select a zone.
3. Within the selected zone, go to **Reference zone**.
4. Select **Add reference zone**. If your zone already has a reference zone set up, you must first remove it. As explained in the [configuration conditions](#configuration-conditions), each internal zone can only reference one other zone at a time.
5. Find the zone you want to use as reference and choose **Select** in the respective row.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="API">

Use the [Update DNS settings](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/subresources/zone/methods/edit/) endpoint. In `--json`, specify the `internal_dns` object with the parameter `reference_zone_id`.

<Example>
<Render file="internal-reference-zone-api" product="dns" />

A third zone (C) could also point to zone B as a reference, but zone A cannot add another zone as a reference while also having zone B configured as its reference zone.
