Normal DNS records map a domain name to one or multiple IP addresses or other associated resources to a specific domain name (a one-to-many mapping). Wildcard DNS records allow you to have a many-to-many mapping, for example if you had hundreds or thousands of subdomains you wanted to point to the same resources.

Within Cloudflare, wildcard DNS records can be either [proxied or DNS-only](/dns/proxy-status/).

## Create a Wildcard record

To create a wildcard DNS record, [create a DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) with an `*` in the **Name** field.

<Example>

| Type | Name | IPv4 address | Proxy status |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `A`  | `*`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      |

</Example>

:::caution


If your project is on [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/), note that wildcard custom domains are not supported. Refer to [known issues](/pages/platform/known-issues/#custom-domains) for details.


:::

You can also create a wildcard DNS record specifically for a deeper subdomain. For example, if you wanted to create a wildcard record on `*.www.example.com`, you would create a record with `*.www` in the name field.

<Example>

| Type    | Name    | IPv4 address  | Proxy status |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| `CNAME` | `*.www` | `example.com` | Proxied      |

</Example>

### Aspects to consider

#### Wildcards are only supported on the first label

This means that a hostname such as `subdomain.*.example.com` is not a wildcard on the level of the asterisk character. If you create a DNS record with that name, the asterisk is interpreted as the literal character `*` and not as the wildcard operator.

#### Wildcards are multi-level by default

If you create a DNS record on `*.*.example.com`, only the first asterisk is interpreted as a wildcard while the second one is interpreted as the literal `*` character. A record `*.example.com` is already multi-level by default, meaning it would cover `abc.example.com` as well as `123.abc.example.com`, as long as there are no [specific DNS records](#specific-dns-records-take-precedence-over-wildcard-records) that would take precedence.

#### Specific DNS records take precedence over wildcard records

A wildcard record applies only when no exact record exists at the queried name. If a record or delegation exists, the wildcard does not apply.

  <Details header="Example 1 - specific or below">

  If you have only these two records on your domain:

  | Type  | Name                      | Content       |
  | ----- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
  | `A`   | `*`           | `192.0.2.1`   |
  | `TXT` | `abc` | `<some_text>` |

  The `A` wildcard record will be used for queries going to any subdomain of `example.com` except `abc.example.com` or anything below that specific label (`123.abc.example.com` or `deeper.label.abc.example.com`, and so on).

  The wildcard will still be used for deeper labels that are not below the specific record on `abc.example.com` — for example, `deeper.label.xyz.example.com`.

	<Details header="Example 2 - implicit parent">

	  If you have only these two records on your domain:

  | Type  | Name                      | Content       |
  | ----- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
  | `A`   | `*`           | `192.0.2.1`   |
  | `TXT` | `123.abc` | `<some_text>` |

	In this example, `123.abc.example.com` is a descendant of `abc.example.com`, and `abc.example.com` has no records associated with it. The behavior will depend on the type of nameservers you are using:

	- Standard nameservers: The wildcard `*.example.com` will still apply to `abc.example.com`.
	- [Advanced nameservers](/dns/foundation-dns/setup/)[^1]: In compliance with [RFC 4592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4592.html), the wildcard `*.example.com` will not apply to `abc.example.com`.

## Availability

Customers on all plans can create and proxy wildcard DNS records.

## Limitations

If you are using a [partial (CNAME) setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/) for your DNS, Cloudflare does not automatically provision SSL/TLS certificates for your wildcard record.
