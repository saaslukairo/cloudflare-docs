This guide details the Workflows API within Cloudflare Workers, including methods, types, and usage examples.

## WorkflowEntrypoint

The `WorkflowEntrypoint` class is the core element of a Workflow definition. A Workflow must extend this class and define a `run` method with at least one `step` call to be considered a valid Workflow.

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// Steps here
	}
}
```

### run

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <code>run(event: WorkflowEvent&lt;T&gt;, step: WorkflowStep): Promise&lt;T&gt;</code>
  - `event` - the event passed to the Workflow, including an optional `payload` containing data (parameters)
  - `step` - the `WorkflowStep` type that provides the step methods for your Workflow

The `run` method can optionally return data, which is available when querying the instance status via the [Workers API](/workflows/build/workers-api/#instancestatus), [REST API](/api/resources/workflows/subresources/instances/subresources/status/) and the Workflows dashboard. This can be useful if your Workflow is computing a result, returning the key to data stored in object storage, or generating some kind of identifier you need to act on.

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// Steps here
		let someComputedState = await step.do("my step", async () => {});

		// Optional: return state from our run() method
		return someComputedState;
	}
}
```

The `WorkflowEvent` type accepts an optional [type parameter](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#working-with-generic-type-variables) that allows you to provide a type for the `payload` property within the `WorkflowEvent`.

Refer to the [events and parameters](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) documentation for how to handle events within your Workflow code.

Finally, any JS control-flow primitive (if conditions, loops, try-catches, promises, etc) can be used to manage steps inside the `run` method.

## WorkflowEvent

```ts
export type WorkflowEvent<T> = {
	payload: Readonly<T>;
	timestamp: Date;
	instanceId: string;
};
```

- The `WorkflowEvent` is the first argument to a Workflow's `run` method, and includes an optional `payload` parameter and a `timestamp` property.
  - `payload` - a default type of `any` or type `T` if a type parameter is provided.
  - `timestamp` - a `Date` object set to the time the Workflow instance was created (triggered).
  - `instanceId` - the ID of the associated instance.

Refer to the [events and parameters](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) documentation for how to handle events within your Workflow code.

## WorkflowStep

### step

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <code>step.do(name: string, callback: (): RpcSerializable): Promise&lt;T&gt;</code>
- <code>step.do(name: string, config?: WorkflowStepConfig, callback: ():
  	RpcSerializable): Promise&lt;T&gt;</code>
  - `name` - the name of the step, up to 256 characters.
  - `config` (optional) - an optional `WorkflowStepConfig` for configuring [step specific retry behaviour](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/).
  - `callback` - an asynchronous function that optionally returns serializable state for the Workflow to persist.

:::note[Returning state]

When returning state from a `step`, ensure that the object you return is _serializable_.

Primitive types like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`, along with composite structures such as `Array` and `Object` (provided they only contain serializable values), can be serialized.

Objects that include `Function` or `Symbol` types, and objects with circular references, cannot be serialized and the Workflow instance will throw an error if objects with those types is returned.

:::

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <code>step.sleep(name: string, duration: WorkflowDuration): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>
  - `name` - the name of the step.
  - `duration` - the duration to sleep until, in either seconds or as a `WorkflowDuration` compatible string.
  - Refer to the [documentation on sleeping and retrying](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/) to learn more about how Workflows are retried.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <code>step.sleepUntil(name: string, timestamp: Date | number): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>
  - `name` - the name of the step.
  - `timestamp` - a JavaScript `Date` object or seconds from the Unix epoch to sleep the Workflow instance until.

:::note

`step.sleep` and `step.sleepUntil` methods do not count towards the maximum Workflow steps limit.

More information about the limits imposed on Workflow can be found in the [Workflows limits documentation](/workflows/reference/limits/).

:::

- <code>step.waitForEvent(name: string, options: ): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>
  - `name` - the name of the step.
  - `options` - an object with properties for `type`, which determines which event type this `waitForEvent` call will match on when calling `instance.sendEvent`, and an optional `timeout` property, which defines how long the `waitForEvent` call will block for before throwing a timeout exception. The default timeout is 24 hours.

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// Other steps in your Workflow
		let event = await step.waitForEvent<IncomingStripeWebhook>(
			"receive invoice paid webhook from Stripe",
			{ type: "stripe-webhook", timeout: "1 hour" },
		);
		// Rest of your Workflow
	}
}
```

</TypeScriptExample>

Review the documentation on [events and parameters](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) to learn how to send events to a running Workflow instance.

## WorkflowStepConfig

```ts
export type WorkflowStepConfig = {
	retries?: {
		limit: number;
		delay: string | number;
		backoff?: WorkflowBackoff;
	};
	timeout?: string | number;
};
```

- A `WorkflowStepConfig` is an optional argument to the `do` method of a `WorkflowStep` and defines properties that allow you to configure the retry behaviour of that step.

Refer to the [documentation on sleeping and retrying](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/) to learn more about how Workflows are retried.

## NonRetryableError

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <code>throw new NonRetryableError(message: <Type text="string" />, name <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />)</code>: <Type text="NonRetryableError" />
  - Throws an error that forces the current Workflow instance to fail and not be retried.
  - Refer to the [documentation on sleeping and retrying](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/) to learn more about how Workflows are retried.

## Call Workflows from Workers

Workflows exposes an API directly to your Workers scripts via the [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#what-is-a-binding) concept. Bindings allow you to securely call a Workflow without having to manage API keys or clients.

You can bind to a Workflow by defining a `[[workflows]]` binding within your Wrangler configuration.

For example, to bind to a Workflow called `workflows-starter` and to make it available on the `MY_WORKFLOW` variable to your Worker script, you would configure the following fields within the `[[workflows]]` binding definition:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
#:schema node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
name = "workflows-starter"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-22"

[[workflows]]
# name of your workflow
name = "workflows-starter"
# binding name env.MY_WORKFLOW
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
# this is class that extends the Workflow class in src/index.ts
class_name = "MyWorkflow"
```

</WranglerConfig>

### Bind from Pages

You can bind and trigger Workflows from [Pages Functions](/pages/functions/) by deploying a Workers project with your Workflow definition and then invoking that Worker using [service bindings](/pages/functions/bindings/#service-bindings) or a standard `fetch()` call.

Visit the documentation on [calling Workflows from Pages](/workflows/build/call-workflows-from-pages/) for examples.

### Cross-script calls

You can also bind to a Workflow that is defined in a different Worker script from the script your Workflow definition is in. To do this, provide the `script_name` key with the name of the script to the `[[workflows]]` binding definition in your Wrangler configuration.

For example, if your Workflow is defined in a Worker script named `billing-worker`, but you are calling it from your `web-api-worker` script, your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) would resemble the following:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
#:schema node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
name = "web-api-worker"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-22"

[[workflows]]
# name of your workflow
name = "billing-workflow"
# binding name env.MY_WORKFLOW
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
# this is class that extends the Workflow class in src/index.ts
class_name = "MyWorkflow"
# the script name where the Workflow is defined.
# required if the Workflow is defined in another script.
script_name = "billing-worker"
```

</WranglerConfig>

<Render file="wrangler-typegen" product="workers" />

## Workflow

:::note

Ensure you have a compatibility date `2024-10-22` or later installed when binding to Workflows from within a Workers project.

:::

The `Workflow` type provides methods that allow you to create, inspect the status, and manage running Workflow instances from within a Worker script.
It is part of the generated types produced by [`wrangler types`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#types).

```ts title="./worker-configuration.d.ts"
interface Env {
	// The 'MY_WORKFLOW' variable should match the "binding" value set in the Wrangler config file
	MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
}
```

The `Workflow` type exports the following methods:

### create

Create (trigger) a new instance of the given Workflow.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <code>create(options?: WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions): Promise&lt;WorkflowInstance&gt;</code>
  - `options` - optional properties to pass when creating an instance, including a user-provided ID and payload parameters.

An ID is automatically generated, but a user-provided ID can be specified (up to 100 characters [^1]). This can be useful when mapping Workflows to users, merchants or other identifiers in your system. You can also provide a JSON object as the `params` property, allowing you to pass data for the Workflow instance to act on as its [`WorkflowEvent`](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/).

```ts
// Create a new Workflow instance with your own ID and pass params to the Workflow instance
let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
	id: myIdDefinedFromOtherSystem,
	params: { hello: "world" },
});
return Response.json({
	id: instance.id,
	details: await instance.status(),
});
```

Returns a `WorkflowInstance`.

Throws an error if the provided ID is already used by an existing instance that has not yet passed its [retention limit](/workflows/reference/limits/). To re-run a workflow with the same ID, you can [`restart`](/workflows/build/trigger-workflows/#restart-a-workflow) the existing instance. 

<Render file="workflows-type-parameters" product="workflows" />

To provide an optional type parameter to the `Workflow`, pass a type argument with your type when defining your Workflow bindings:

```ts
interface User {
	email: string;
	createdTimestamp: number;
}

interface Env {
	// Pass our User type as the type parameter to the Workflow definition
  MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow<User>;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		// More likely to come from your database or via the request body!
		const user: User = {
			email: user@example.com,
			createdTimestamp: Date.now()
		}

		let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
			// params expects the type User
			params: user
		})

		return Response.json({
			id: instance.id,
			details: await instance.status(),
		});
	}
}
```

### createBatch

Create (trigger) a batch of new instance of the given Workflow, up to 100 instances at a time.

This is useful when you are scheduling multiple instances at once. A call to `createBatch` is treated the same as a call to `create` (for a single instance) and allows you to work within the [instance creation limit](/workflows/reference/limits/).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
- <code>createBatch(batch: WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions[]): Promise&lt;WorkflowInstance[]&gt;</code>
  - `batch` - list of Options to pass when creating an instance, including a user-provided ID and payload parameters.

Each element of the `batch` list is expected to include both `id` and `params` properties:

```ts
// Create a new batch of 3 Workflow instances, each with its own ID and pass params to the Workflow instances
const listOfInstances = [
	{ id: "id-abc123", params: { hello: "world-0" } },
	{ id: "id-def456", params: { hello: "world-1" } },
	{ id: "id-ghi789", params: { hello: "world-2" } },
];
let instances = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.createBatch(listOfInstances);
```

Returns an array of `WorkflowInstance`.

Unlike [`create`](/workflows/build/workers-api/#create), this operation is idempotent and will not fail if an ID is already in use. If an existing instance with the same ID is still within its [retention limit](/workflows/reference/limits/), it will be skipped and excluded from the returned array.

### get

Get a specific Workflow instance by ID.

- <code>get(id: string): Promise&lt;WorkflowInstance&gt;</code>
  - `id` - the ID of the Workflow instance.

Returns a `WorkflowInstance`. Throws an exception if the instance ID does not exist.

```ts
// Fetch an existing Workflow instance by ID:
try {
	let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(id);
	return Response.json({
		id: instance.id,
		details: await instance.status(),
	});
} catch (e: any) {
	// Handle errors
	// .get will throw an exception if the ID doesn't exist or is invalid.
	const msg = `failed to get instance ${id}: ${e.message}`;
	console.error(msg);
	return Response.json({ error: msg }, { status: 400 });
}
```

## WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions

Optional properties to pass when creating an instance.

```ts
interface WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions {
	/**
	 * An id for your Workflow instance. Must be unique within the Workflow.
	 */
	id?: string;
	/**
	 * The event payload the Workflow instance is triggered with
	 */
	params?: unknown;
}
```

## WorkflowInstance

Represents a specific instance of a Workflow, and provides methods to manage the instance.

```ts
declare abstract class WorkflowInstance {
	public id: string;
	/**
	 * Pause the instance.
	 */
	public pause(): Promise<void>;
	/**
	 * Resume the instance. If it is already running, an error will be thrown.
	 */
	public resume(): Promise<void>;
	/**
	 * Terminate the instance. If it is errored, terminated or complete, an error will be thrown.
	 */
	public terminate(): Promise<void>;
	/**
	 * Restart the instance.
	 */
	public restart(): Promise<void>;
	/**
	 * Returns the current status of the instance.
	 */
	public status(): Promise<InstanceStatus>;
}
```

### id

Return the id of a Workflow.

- <code>id: string</code>

### status

Return the status of a running Workflow instance.

- <code>status(): Promise&lt;InstanceStatus&gt;</code>

### pause

Pause a running Workflow instance.

- <code>pause(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### resume

Resume a paused Workflow instance.

- <code>resume(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### restart

Restart a Workflow instance.

- <code>restart(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### terminate

Terminate a Workflow instance.

- <code>terminate(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### sendEvent

[Send an event](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) to a running Workflow instance.

- <code>sendEvent(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>
  - `options` - the event `type` and `payload` to send to the Workflow instance. The `type` must match the `type` in the corresponding `waitForEvent` call in your Workflow.

Return `void` on success; throws an exception if the Workflow is not running or is an errored state.

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
export default {
	async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
		const instanceId = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("instanceId");
		const webhookPayload = await req.json<Payload>();

		let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(instanceId);
		// Send our event, with `type` matching the event type defined in
		// our step.waitForEvent call
		await instance.sendEvent({
			type: "stripe-webhook",
			payload: webhookPayload,
		});

		return Response.json({
			status: await instance.status(),
		});
	},
};
```

</TypeScriptExample>

You can call `sendEvent` multiple times, setting the value of the `type` property to match the specific `waitForEvent` calls in your Workflow.

This allows you to wait for multiple events at once, or use `Promise.race` to wait for multiple events and allow the first event to progress the Workflow.

### InstanceStatus

Details the status of a Workflow instance.

```ts
type InstanceStatus = {
	status:
		| "queued" // means that instance is waiting to be started (see concurrency limits)
		| "running"
		| "paused"
		| "errored"
		| "terminated" // user terminated the instance while it was running
		| "complete"
		| "waiting" // instance is hibernating and waiting for sleep or event to finish
		| "waitingForPause" // instance is finishing the current work to pause
		| "unknown";
	error?: string;
	output?: object;
};
```
