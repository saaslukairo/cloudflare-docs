<Description>

Improve your network and cloud traffic visibility. Customers with public IPs can also detect DDoS attacks based on their traffic flows.

</Description>

<Plan type="all" />

Magic Network Monitoring provides visibility into your network traffic and cloud traffic by analyzing network <GlossaryTooltip term="flow data">flow data</GlossaryTooltip> sent from a customer's routers or cloud environment. Magic Network Monitoring supports NetFlow v5, NetFlow v9, IPFIX, and sFlow. In cloud environments, Magic Network Monitoring supports AWS VPC flow logs via AWS Firehose.

Magic Network Monitoring is generally available to everyone with a Cloudflare account by default. You can log in to your Cloudflare dashboard, select your account, then go to the **Magic Monitoring** page to get started.

Everyone can use the [free version](/magic-network-monitoring/magic-network-monitoring-free/) of Magic Network Monitoring in a home network, network lab, or business to get end to end visibility across their network traffic. Potential enterprise customers are encouraged to use the free version to run a proof of concept.
