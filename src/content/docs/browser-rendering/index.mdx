<Description>

Run headless Chrome on [Cloudflare's global network](/workers/) for browser automation, web scraping, testing, and content generation.

</Description>

<Plan type="workers-all" />

Browser Rendering enables developers to programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances running on Cloudflare’s global network.

## Use Cases

Browser Rendering supports a wide range of use cases, including:
- Extract rendered HTML or convert webpages to Markdown using the [content endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/content-endpoint/) and [markdown endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/markdown-endpoint/)
- Create website thumbnails and social previews using the [screenshot endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/screenshot-endpoint/)
- Generate PDFs from webpages and HTML content using the [pdf endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/pdf-endpoint/)
- Archive complete webpage states with the [snapshot endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/snapshot/) that captures both HTML and screenshots
- Build web scrapers that target specific elements or extract all links using the [scrape endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/scrape-endpoint/) and [links endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/links-endpoint/)
- Parse and structure webpage data into JSON format using the [json endpoint](/browser-rendering/rest-api/json-endpoint/)

Browser Rendering is also ideal for agentic workflows. Use [Puppeteer](/browser-rendering/puppeteer/), [Playwright](/browser-rendering/playwright/), [Playwright MCP](/browser-rendering/playwright/playwright-mcp/), or [Stagehand](/browser-rendering/stagehand/) to power AI agents that interact with web pages and extract data where APIs do not exist.

## Key features

- **Scale to thousands of browsers**: Instant access to a global pool of browsers with low cold-start time, ideal for high-volume screenshot generation, data extraction, or automation at scale
- **Global by default**: Browser sessions run on Cloudflare's edge network, opening close to your users for better speed and availability worldwide
- **Easy to integrate**: [REST APIs](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) for common actions, while [Puppeteer](/browser-rendering/puppeteer/) and [Playwright](/browser-rendering/playwright/) provide familiar automation libraries for complex workflows
- **Session management**: [Reuse browser sessions](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/reuse-sessions/) across requests to improve performance and reduce cold-start overhead
- **Flexible pricing**: Pay only for browser time used with generous free tier ([view pricing](/browser-rendering/pricing/))

## Integration Methods

You can integrate Browser Rendering into your applications using one of the following methods:

- **[REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/)**: Ideal for simple, stateless tasks like capturing screenshots, generating PDFs, extracting HTML content, and more.
- **[Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/)**: Suitable for advanced browser automation within [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). This method provides greater control, enabling more complex workflows and persistent sessions.

Choose the method that best fits your use case. For example, use the [REST API endpoints](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) for straightforward tasks from external applications and use [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/) for complex automation within the Cloudflare ecosystem.
