Cloudflare Browser Rendering allows you to programmatically control a headless browser, enabling you to do things like take screenshots, generate PDFs, and perform automated browser tasks.

There are two ways to use Browser Rendering:
- [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) for simple, one-off actions, like taking a screenshot, fetching HTML, or generating a PDF.
- [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/) for more complex, multi-step browser automation using [Puppeteer](/browser-rendering/puppeteer/) and [Playwright](/browser-rendering/playwright/).

This guide will help you choose the right path for your needs and get you started with your first Browser Rendering project.

## REST API

The REST API is best for situations where you have an existing application and want to perform simple, stateless browser actions.

### Prerequisites
- Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages).
- Create a [Cloudflare API Token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `Browser Rendering - Edit` permissions.

### Example: Take a screenshot of the Cloudflare homepage

<Render
  file="example-screenshot-from-url"
  product="browser-rendering"
/>

The REST API can also be used to:

- [Fetch HTML](/browser-rendering/rest-api/content-endpoint/)
- [Generate a PDF](/browser-rendering/rest-api/pdf-endpoint/)
- [and more...](/browser-rendering/rest-api/)

## Workers Bindings

Workers Bindings are best for situations where you need to build more complex, multi-step browser automation workflows. You can use familiar tools like [Puppeteer](/browser-rendering/puppeteer/) and [Playwright](/browser-rendering/playwright/).

### Prerequisites
<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

### Example: Navigate to a URL, take a screenshot, and store in KV

<Render
  file="example-workers-binding-screenshots-from-web"
  product="browser-rendering"
/>
