## Getting started & Development

### Does local development support all Browser Rendering features?

Not yet. Local development currently has the following limitation(s):
- Requests larger than 1 MB are not supported.

<Render file="remote-binding-note" product="workers" />

### Will Browser Rendering bypass Cloudflare's Bot Protection?

No, Browser Rendering requests are always identified as bots by Cloudflare and do not bypass Bot Protection.

If you are attempting to scan your **own zone** and need Browser Rendering to access areas protected by Cloudflare’s Bot Protection, you can create a [WAF skip rule](/waf/custom-rules/skip/) to bypass the bot protection using a header or a custom user agent.

### Does Browser Rendering rotate IP addresses for outbound requests?

No. Browser Rendering requests originate from Cloudflare's global network and you cannot configure per-request IP rotation. All rendering traffic comes from Cloudflare IP ranges and requests include [automatic headers](/browser-rendering/reference/automatic-request-headers/), such as `cf-biso-request-id` and `cf-biso-devtools` so origin servers can identify them.

### Is there a limit to how many requests a single browser session can handle?

There is no fixed limit on the number of requests per browser session. A single browser can handle multiple requests as long as it stays within available compute and memory limits.

## Errors & Troubleshooting

### `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fetch')`

This error typically occurs because your Puppeteer launch is not receiving the Browser binding. To resolve: Pass your Browser binding into `puppeteer.launch`.

### `Error processing the request: Unable to create new browser: code: 429: message: Browser time limit exceeded for today`

This error indicates you have hit the daily browser-instance limit on the Workers Free plan. [Free-plan accounts are capped at free plan limit is 10 minutes of browser use a day](/browser-rendering/limits/#workers-free) once you exceed those, further creation attempts return a 429 until the next UTC day.

To resolve: [Upgrade to a Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/) which allows for more than 10 minutes of usage a day and has higher [limits](/browser-rendering/limits/#workers-paid). If you recently upgraded but still see this error, try redeploying your Worker to ensure your usage is correctly associated with your new plan.

### `422 Unprocessable Entity`

A `422 Unprocessable Entity` error usually means that Browser Rendering wasn’t able to complete an action because of an issue with the site.

This can happen if:
- The website consumes too much memory during rendering.
- The page itself crashed or returned an error before the action completed.
- The request exceeded one of the [timeout limits](/browser-rendering/reference/timeouts/) for page load, element load, or an action.

Most often, this error is caused by a timeout. You can review the different timers and their limits in the [REST API timeouts reference](/browser-rendering/reference/timeouts/).
