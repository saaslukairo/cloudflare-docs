Zaraz is available to all Cloudflare users, across all tiers. Each month, every Cloudflare account gets 1,000,000 free Zaraz Events. For additional usage, the Zaraz Paid plan costs $5 per month for each additional 1,000,000 Zaraz Events.

All Zaraz features and tools are always available on all accounts. Learn more about our pricing in [the following pricing announcement](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zaraz-announces-new-pricing)

## The Zaraz Event unit

One Zaraz Event is an event you are sending to Zaraz, whether that is a page view, a `zaraz.track` event, or similar. You can easily see the total number of Zaraz Events you are currently using on the **Monitoring** page of the Cloudflare dashboard:
   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/tag-management/monitoring" />

## Enabling Zaraz Paid

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Zaraz plans** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/tag-management/plans" />
2. Click the **Enable Zaraz usage billing** button and follow the instructions.

## Using Zaraz Free

If you don't enable Zaraz Paid, you'll receive email notifications when you reach 50%, 80%, and 90% of your free allocation. Zaraz will be disabled until the next billing cycle if you exceed 1,000,000 events without enabling Zaraz Paid.
