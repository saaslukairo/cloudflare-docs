Exporting your Zaraz configuration can be useful if you want to create a local backup or if you need to import it to another website. Zaraz provides an easy way to export and import your configuration.

## Export your Zaraz configuration

To export your Zaraz configuration:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Settings** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/tag-management/settings" />
2. Go to **Advanced**.
3. Click "Export" to download your configuration.

## Import your Zaraz configuration

:::caution


Importing a Zaraz configuration replaces your existing configuration, meaning that any information you did not back up could be lost. Consider exporting your existing configuration before importing a new one.
