Version History enables you to keep track of all the Zaraz configuration changes made in your website. With Version History you can also revert changes to previous settings should there be a problem.

To access Version History you need to enable [Preview & Publish mode](/zaraz/history/preview-mode/) first. Then, you can access Version History under **Zaraz** > **History**.

## Access Version History

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **History** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/tag-management/history" />
3. If this is your first time using this feature, this page will be empty. Otherwise, you will have a list of changes made to your account with the following information:
   * Date of change
   * User who made the change
   * Description of the change

## Revert changes
