You can add custom CSS to the Zaraz Consent Management Platform, to make the consent modal more in-line with your website's design.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Consent** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/tag-management/consent" />
2. Find the **Custom CSS** section, and add your custom CSS code as you would on any other HTML editor.
