<Description>
	Create AI-powered search for your data
</Description>

<Plan type="all" />

AI Search (formerly AutoRAG) is Cloudflare’s managed search service. You can connect your data such as websites or unstructured content, and it automatically creates a continuously updating index that you can query with natural language in your applications or AI agents. It natively integrates with Cloudflare’s developer platform tools like Vectorize, AI Gateway, R2, and Workers AI, while also supporting third-party providers and open standards. 

It supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns, enabling you to build enterprise search, natural language search, and AI-powered chat without managing infrastructure.
