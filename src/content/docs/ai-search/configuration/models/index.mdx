AI Search uses models at multiple stages. You can configure which models are used, or let AI Search automatically select a smart default for you.

## Models usage

AI Search leverages Workers AI models in the following stages:

- Image to markdown conversion (if images are in data source): Converts image content to Markdown using object detection and captioning models.
- Embedding: Transforms your documents and queries into vector representations for semantic search.
- Query rewriting (optional): Reformulates the user’s query to improve retrieval accuracy.
- Generation: Produces the final response from retrieved context.

## Model providers

All AI Search instances support models from [Workers AI](/workers-ai). You can use other providers (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) in AI Search by adding their API keys to an [AI Gateway](/ai-gateway) and connecting that gateway to your AI Search.

To use AI Search with other model providers:

1. Add provider keys to AI Gateway
- Go to **AI > AI Gateway** in the dashboard.
- Select or create an AI gateway.
- In **Provider Keys**, choose your provider, click **Add**, and enter the key.
2. Connect the gateway to AI Search
- When creating a new AI Search, select the AI Gateway with your provider keys.
- For an existing AI Search, go to **Settings** and switch to a gateway that has your keys under **Resources**.
3. Select models
- Embedding model: Only available to be changed when creating a new AI Search.
- Generation model: Can be selected when creating a new AI Search and can be changed at any time in **Settings**.

AI Search supports a subset of models that have been selected to provide the best experience. See list of [supported models](/ai-search/configuration/models/supported-models/).

### Smart default

If you choose **Smart Default** in your model selection, then AI Search will select a Cloudflare recommended model and will update it automatically for you over time. You can switch to explicit model configuration at any time by visiting **Settings**.

### Per-request generation model override

While the generation model can be set globally at the AI Search instance level, you can also override it on a per-request basis in the [AI Search API](/ai-search/usage/rest-api/#ai-search). This is useful if your [RAG application](/ai-search/) requires dynamic selection of generation models based on context or user preferences.

## Model deprecation
AI Search may deprecate support for a given model in order to provide support for better-performing models with improved capabilities. When a model is being deprecated, we announce the change and provide an end-of-life date after which the model will no longer be accessible. Applications that depend on AI Search may therefore require occasional updates to continue working reliably.

### Model lifecycle
AI Search models follow a defined lifecycle to ensure stability and predictable deprecation:

1. **Production:** The model is actively supported and recommended for use. It is included in Smart Defaults and receives ongoing updates and maintenance.
2. **Announcement & Transition:** The model remains available but has been marked for deprecation. An end-of-life date is communicated through documentation, release notes, and other official channels. During this phase, users are encouraged to migrate to the recommended replacement model.
3. **Automatic Upgrade (if applicable):** If you have selected the Smart Default option, AI Search will automatically upgrade requests to a recommended replacement.
4. **End of life:** The model is no longer available. Any requests to the retired model return a clear error message, and the model is removed from documentation and Smart Defaults.

See models are their lifecycle status in [supported models](/ai-search/configuration/models/supported-models/).

### Best practices

- Regularly check the [release note](/ai-search/platform/release-note/) for updates.
- Plan migration efforts according to the communicated end-of-life date.
- Migrate and test the recommended replacement models before the end-of-life date.
