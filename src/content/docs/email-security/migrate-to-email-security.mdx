<Render file="contact-support" product="email-security" />

## Contact support

In Area 1, you can reach out to support via the following email addresses:

- support@area1security.com
- phishguard@area1security.com (for PhishGuard customers only)

In Email security, you can raise a ticket by contacting [technical support](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/support) on the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Select your account and choose **Technical support**.
2. In **Solve your issue**, answer the following questions:
   - What type of question do you have? Select **Technical - Other Products**
   - In what area can we help you? Select **Email security**
   - What feature, service or problem is this related to? Choose among **Configuration**, **Detections** or **PhishGuard**.

## Invite users

In Area 1, you [invite users](/email-security/account-setup/manage-account-members/#add-user) by logging in to the Area 1 portal and inviting members.

To invite users in Zero Trust Email security:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **Manage Account**.
3. Select **Members** > **Invite** > [Add account members](/fundamentals/manage-members/manage/#add-account-members).

Once you have added new account members, you will have to assign each member an [Email security role](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/#email-security-roles).

## Create webhooks

:::note
Starting from October 1, 2025, Area 1 webhooks will be visible in Zero Trust Email security, but non-configurable. Use [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/enable-logs/#enable-user-action-logs) to create new webhooks or configure webhooks.
:::

In Area 1, you can [create alert webhooks](/email-security/email-configuration/domains-and-routing/alert-webhooks/#create-an-alert-webhook).

In Zero Trust Email security, webhooks are instead referred to as logs. You can enable [detection logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/enable-logs/#enable-detection-logs) and/or [user action logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/enable-logs/#enable-user-action-logs). Additionally, you can enable [Outbound Data Loss Prevention](/cloudflare-one/email-security/outbound-dlp/) to protect sensitive information in outbound emails.

## Set up system alerts

You can check the Area 1 and Email security status in the [Cloudflare System Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/).

To view Area 1 status:

- Search for **Email security (Area1)** and check that the status is set to **Operational**. This means that emails are being processed.
- Search for **Area 1 - Dash** to check the status of the Area 1 dashboard.
- Search for **Area 1 - API** to check the status of the API endpoints.

To view Email security status:

- Search for **Email security (Zero Trust)** and check that the status is set to **Operational**. This means that emails are being processed.
- Search for **Zero Trust Dashboard** to check the status of the Zero Trust dashboard.
- Search for **API** to check the status of the API endpoints.

You can also check the status of APIs through the [Cloudflare Status API](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/api) and configure [Cloudflare Notifications](/notifications/get-started/#configure-notifications).

## Email reports

:::note
Starting from October 1, 2025, weekly and daily email reports will no longer be available. Go to [Monitoring](/cloudflare-one/email-security/monitoring/) in Email security to monitor your inbox.
:::

In Area 1, you receive daily or weekly updates of the number of emails dispositioned.

In Email security, you can view [email monitoring](/cloudflare-one/email-security/monitoring/) over the last 90, 30, 7, 3, 1 day(s).

## Email alerts for detections

:::note
Starting from October 1, 2025, emails alerts for detections will no longer be available. As an alternative, use [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/enable-logs/#enable-detection-logs).
:::

In Area 1, you receive an email when an email is assigned a disposition.

In Email security, you enable [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/enable-logs/#enable-detection-logs) to enable detection logs.

## Search emails

In Area 1, you can perform two types of search: [Fielded Search](/email-security/reporting/search/#fielded-search) and [Freeform Search](/email-security/reporting/search/#freeform-search).

In Email security, the ability to search emails has been expanded. You can use three different [screen criteria](/cloudflare-one/email-security/investigation/search-email/#screen-criteria) to search emails:

- [Advanced screen](/cloudflare-one/email-security/investigation/search-email/#advanced-screen)
- [Regular screen](/cloudflare-one/email-security/investigation/search-email/#regular-screen)
- [Popular screen](/cloudflare-one/email-security/investigation/search-email/#popular-screen)

## Check metrics

In Area 1, you can check [statistics](/email-security/reporting/statistics-overview/) in your Home section.

In Email security, you can check your metrics in the [Monitoring](/cloudflare-one/email-security/monitoring/) section in the dashboard.

## Move messages to a specific folder

Area 1 allows you to set up [message retraction](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/) to move messages to specific folders. This is known as **retraction**.

Moving messages to a specific folder is known as [auto-moves](/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/auto-moves/) in Zero Trust Email security.

## Create policies

This table displays the difference in terminology used when creating policies:

| Area 1                                                                                        | Email security                                                                                             |

| [Added detections](/email-security/email-configuration/enhanced-detections/added-detections/) | [Additional detections](/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/additional-detections/) |

## Reclassifications

This table displays the difference in terminology used when finding emails whose disposition is incorrect:

| Area 1                                                                                                                                                                                   | Email security                                                                                 |

## Business Email Compromise

In Area 1, you can set up a [Business email compromise (BEC)](/email-security/email-configuration/enhanced-detections/business-email-compromise/) list to protect against attackers who try to impersonate executives.

In Email security, this feature is known as [impersonation registry](/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/).

## Synchronize directories

In Area 1, you can [integrate directories](/email-security/email-configuration/enhanced-detections/business-email-compromise/#integrating-a-directory) in your email provider.

In Email security, you can add and sync [directories](/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/).

## API

:::note
Area 1 API endpoints will deprecate on December 18, 2025. Use the [Email security API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/email_security/) endpoints to prevent interruption to your normal operations.
:::

To access Area 1 API, go to the [API Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-security/static/api_documentation_1.38.1.pdf). You can set up a [service account](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-security/api/service-accounts/) to configure API tokens.

To access Email security API, go to [Email security API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/email_security/). You can set up an [API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) to use the Email security API.
