Configure sandbox behavior by passing options when creating a sandbox instance with `getSandbox()`.

## Available options

```ts
import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

const sandbox = getSandbox(binding, sandboxId, options?: SandboxOptions);
```

### keepAlive

**Type**: `boolean`
**Default**: `false`

Keep the container alive indefinitely by preventing automatic shutdown. When `true`, the container will never auto-timeout and must be explicitly destroyed using `destroy()`.

<TypeScriptExample>
```ts
// For long-running processes that need the container to stay alive
const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123', {
  keepAlive: true
});

// Run your long-running process
await sandbox.startProcess('python long_running_script.py');

// Important: Must explicitly destroy when done
try {
  // Your work here
} finally {
  await sandbox.destroy(); // Required to prevent containers running indefinitely
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

:::caution[Resource management with keepAlive]
When `keepAlive: true` is set, containers will not automatically timeout. They must be explicitly destroyed using `destroy()` to prevent containers running indefinitely and counting toward your account limits.
:::

## When to use keepAlive

Use `keepAlive: true` for:

- **Long-running builds** - CI/CD pipelines that may have idle periods between steps
- **Batch processing** - Jobs that process data in waves with gaps between batches
- **Monitoring tasks** - Processes that periodically check external services
- **Interactive sessions** - User-driven workflows where the container should remain available

By default, containers automatically shut down after 10 minutes of inactivity. The `keepAlive` option prevents this automatic shutdown.
