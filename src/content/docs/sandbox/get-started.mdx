Build your first application with Sandbox SDK - a secure code execution environment. In this guide, you'll create a Worker that can execute Python code and work with files in isolated containers.

:::note[What you're building]
A simple API that can safely execute Python code and perform file operations in isolated sandbox environments.
:::

## Prerequisites

<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

### Ensure Docker is running locally

Sandbox SDK uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build container images alongside your Worker.

<Render product="containers" file="docker-setup" />

## 1. Create a new project

Create a new Sandbox SDK project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-sandbox --template=cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/examples/minimal"}
/>

This creates a `my-sandbox` directory with everything you need:

- `src/index.ts` - Worker with sandbox integration
- `wrangler.jsonc` - Configuration for Workers and Containers
- `Dockerfile` - Container environment definition

```sh
cd my-sandbox
```

## 2. Explore the template

The template provides a minimal Worker that demonstrates core sandbox capabilities:

```typescript
import { getSandbox, proxyToSandbox, type Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

export { Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

type Env = {
	Sandbox: DurableObjectNamespace<Sandbox>;
};

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const url = new URL(request.url);

		// Get or create a sandbox instance
		const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, "my-sandbox");

		// Execute Python code
		if (url.pathname === "/run") {
			const result = await sandbox.exec('python3 -c "print(2 + 2)"');
			return Response.json({
				output: result.stdout,
				error: result.stderr,
				exitCode: result.exitCode,
				success: result.success,
			});
		}

		// Work with files
		if (url.pathname === "/file") {
			await sandbox.writeFile("/workspace/hello.txt", "Hello, Sandbox!");
			const file = await sandbox.readFile("/workspace/hello.txt");
			return Response.json({
				content: file.content,
			});
		}

		return new Response("Try /run or /file");
	},
};
```

**Key concepts**:

- `getSandbox()` - Gets or creates a sandbox instance by ID. Use the same ID to reuse the same sandbox instance across requests.
- `sandbox.exec()` - Execute shell commands in the sandbox and capture stdout, stderr, and exit codes.
- `sandbox.writeFile()` / `readFile()` - Write and read files in the sandbox filesystem.

## 3. Test locally

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# If you expect to have multiple sandbox instances, you can increase `max_instances`.
```

:::note
First run builds the Docker container (2-3 minutes). Subsequent runs are much faster due to caching.
:::

Test the endpoints:

```sh
# Execute Python code
curl http://localhost:8787/run

# File operations
curl http://localhost:8787/file
```

You should see JSON responses with the command output and file contents.

## 4. Deploy to production

Deploy your Worker and container:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

This will:

1. Build your container image using Docker
2. Push it to Cloudflare's Container Registry
3. Deploy your Worker globally

:::caution[Wait for provisioning]
After first deployment, wait 2-3 minutes before making requests. The Worker deploys immediately, but the container needs time to provision.
:::

Check deployment status:

```sh
npx wrangler containers list
```

## 5. Test your deployment

Visit your Worker URL (shown in deploy output):

```sh
# Replace with your actual URL
curl https://my-sandbox.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/run
```

Your sandbox is now deployed and can execute code in isolated containers.

:::note[Preview URLs require custom domain]
If you plan to expose ports from sandboxes (using `exposePort()` for preview URLs), you will need to set up a custom domain with wildcard DNS routing. The `.workers.dev` domain does not support the subdomain patterns required for preview URLs. See [Production Deployment](/sandbox/guides/production-deployment/) when you are ready to expose services.
:::

## Understanding the configuration

Your `wrangler.jsonc` connects three pieces together:

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc
{
	"containers": [
		{
			"class_name": "Sandbox",
			"image": "./Dockerfile",
			"instance_type": "lite",
			"max_instances": 1,
		},
	],
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [
			{
				"class_name": "Sandbox",
				"name": "Sandbox",
			},
		],
	},
	"migrations": [
		{
			"new_sqlite_classes": ["Sandbox"],
			"tag": "v1",
		},
	],
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

- **containers** - Defines the [container image, instance type, and resource limits](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#containers) for your sandbox environment. If you expect to have multiple sandbox instances, you can increase `max_instances`.
- **durable_objects** - You need not be familiar with [Durable Objects](/durable-objects) to use Sandbox SDK, but if you'd like, you can [learn more about Cloudflare Containers and Durable Objects](/containers/get-started/#each-container-is-backed-by-its-own-durable-object). This configuration creates a [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings#what-is-a-binding) that makes the `Sandbox` Durable Object accessible in your Worker code.
- **migrations** - Registers the `Sandbox` class, implemented by the Sandbox SDK, with [SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage) (required once)

For detailed configuration options including environment variables, secrets, and custom images, see the [Wrangler configuration reference](/sandbox/configuration/wrangler/).

## Next steps

Now that you have a working sandbox, explore more capabilities:

- [Execute commands](/sandbox/guides/execute-commands/) - Run shell commands and stream output
- [Manage files](/sandbox/guides/manage-files/) - Work with files and directories
- [Expose services](/sandbox/guides/expose-services/) - Get public URLs for services running in your sandbox
- [Production Deployment](/sandbox/guides/production-deployment/) - Set up custom domains for preview URLs
- [API reference](/sandbox/api/) - Complete API documentation
