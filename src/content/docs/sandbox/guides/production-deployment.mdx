:::note[Only required for preview URLs]
Custom domain setup is ONLY needed if you use `exposePort()` to expose services from sandboxes. If your application does not expose ports, you can deploy to `.workers.dev` without this configuration.
:::

Deploy your Sandbox SDK application to production with preview URL support. Preview URLs require wildcard DNS routing because they generate unique subdomains for each exposed port: `https://8080-abc123.yourdomain.com`.

The `.workers.dev` domain does not support wildcard subdomains, so production deployments that use preview URLs need a custom domain.

## Prerequisites

- Active Cloudflare zone with a domain
- Worker that uses `exposePort()`
- [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed

## Setup

### Create Wildcard DNS Record

In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your domain and create an A record:

- **Type**: A
- **Name**: * (wildcard)
- **IPv4 address**: 192.0.2.0
- **Proxy status**: Proxied (orange cloud)

This routes all subdomains through Cloudflare's proxy. The IP address `192.0.2.0` is a documentation address (RFC 5737) that Cloudflare recognizes when proxied.

### Configure Worker Routes

Add a wildcard route to your Wrangler configuration:

<WranglerConfig>
```toml
name = "my-sandbox-app"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "$today"

[[routes]]
pattern = "*.yourdomain.com/*"
zone_name = "yourdomain.com"
```
</WranglerConfig>

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain. This routes all subdomain requests to your Worker and enables Cloudflare to provision SSL certificates automatically.

### Deploy

Deploy your Worker:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Verify

Test that preview URLs work:

```typescript
// Extract hostname from request
const { hostname } = new URL(request.url);

const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'test-sandbox');
await sandbox.startProcess('python -m http.server 8080');
const exposed = await sandbox.exposePort(8080, { hostname });

console.log(exposed.exposedAt);
// https://8080-test-sandbox.yourdomain.com
```

Visit the URL in your browser to confirm your service is accessible.

## Troubleshooting

- **CustomDomainRequiredError**: Verify your Worker is not deployed to `.workers.dev` and that the wildcard DNS record and route are configured correctly.
- **SSL/TLS errors**: Wait a few minutes for certificate provisioning. Verify the DNS record is proxied and SSL/TLS mode is set to "Full" or "Full (strict)" in your dashboard.
- **Preview URL not resolving**: Confirm the wildcard DNS record exists and is proxied. Wait 30-60 seconds for DNS propagation.
- **Port not accessible**: Ensure your service binds to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost`) and that `proxyToSandbox()` is called first in your Worker's fetch handler.

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Workers routing documentation](/workers/configuration/routing/).
