Since the Sandbox SDK is built on top of the [Containers](/containers/) platform, it shares the same underlying platform characteristics. Refer to these pages to understand how pricing and limits work for your sandbox deployments.

## Container Limits

Refer to [Containers limits](/containers/platform-details/limits/) for complete details on:

- Memory, vCPU, and disk limits for concurrent container instances
- Instance types and their resource allocations
- Image size and storage limits

## Best Practices

To work within these limits:

- **Right-size your instances** - Choose the appropriate [instance type](/containers/platform-details/limits/#instance-types) based on your workload requirements
- **Clean up unused sandboxes** - Terminate sandbox sessions when they're no longer needed to free up resources
- **Optimize images** - Keep your [custom Dockerfiles](/sandbox/configuration/dockerfile/) lean to reduce image size
