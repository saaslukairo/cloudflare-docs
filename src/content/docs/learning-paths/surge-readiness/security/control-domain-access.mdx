[IP Access Rules](/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/) specify an action based on the origin of your user across a single domain or all of the domains in your account.

IP Access Rules can be applied based on:



* IPv4 address or range: Specified in CIDR notation as `/16` or `/24`
* IPv6 address or range: Specified in CIDR notation as `/32`, `/48`, `/64`
* ASN
* Country or the Tor network


:::note

We recommend locking down your origin with an Access Control List (ACL) which only allows [Cloudflare IPs](http://www.cloudflare.com/ips).

:::

Actions:

- Block: Ensures that an IP address will never be allowed to access your site.
- CAPTCHA Challenge: Rules will be shown a CAPTCHA before allowed access.
- Javascript Challenge: Rules will be shown a five second javascript confirmation.
- Allowlist: Ensures that an IP address will never be blocked from accessing your site. This supersedes any Cloudflare security profile.

:::note

Challenge Passage timeout applies to IP reputation, IUAM mode and user IP Firewall (CAPTCHA or JS Challenge): [cf_clearance cookie](/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/cloudflare-cookies/#additional-cookies-used-by-the-challenge-platform) is set with `Max-age=Challenge Passage`.
