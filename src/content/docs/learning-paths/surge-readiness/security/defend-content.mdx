Scrape Shield is a collection of settings meant to protect your site's content.

## Email Address Obfuscation

[Email Address Obfuscation](/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/) uses JavaScript to encrypt addresses and prevents harvesting by spammers and bots while keeping addresses easy to read and use for human visitors.

## Hotlink Protection

[Hotlink Protection](/waf/tools/scrape-shield/hotlink-protection/) prevents your images from being used by other sites, which can reduce the bandwidth consumed by your origin server.
