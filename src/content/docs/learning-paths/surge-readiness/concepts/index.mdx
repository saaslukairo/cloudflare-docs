Reach out to your Customer Success Manager at least 30 days prior to the expected traffic surge to schedule a Security Optimization walkthrough with your Customer Solution Engineer.

To learn more about our service offerings, refer to [Customer Success offerings](https://www.cloudflare.com/success-offerings/).

## Register your users

For the security and protection of your account, be sure to register all account users.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the  **Manage Account** > **Members** page.

    <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/members" />

2. Select more than one Super Administrator to ensure appropriate access when needed.

:::note

Refer to [Manage members](/fundamentals/manage-members/) to learn how to review and update registered account users. 

:::

Failure to register account users can create issues with our ticketing system. Unverified users who contact support will be funneled to the self-serve queue rather than the Enterprise queue which can result in long wait times.

We strongly advise against credential-sharing which can jeopardize the trust and safety of your account.

## Confirm user and domain administration

- **Multi-User:** Provide role-based permissions to a group of users to better control the administration of your domains. Each user has their own role and limited API key.
- **Enforce 2FA:** Ensure your entire dashboard is secure by [enforcing 2-factor authentication](/fundamentals/user-profiles/2fa/) for your organization.
  - To disable 2FA, submit a support ticket and allow 1-2 business days to validate your request.
- **Leverage API Access:** Work easily with our system programmatically using our [API](https://api.cloudflare.com).

## Additional items

- Check when your [SSL Certificates expire (only custom and origin certificates)](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/renewing/)
  :::note
  Certificates managed by Cloudflare are auto-renewed.

- Review your Operational and Disaster recovery preparedness
    - Enable Load Balancing with smart cache strategies: Use [Cloudflare Load Balancing](/reference-architecture/architectures/load-balancing) to distribute traffic across multiple healthy origins, and increase cache-hit ratios by leveraging [custom cache rules](/cache/performance-review/cache-analytics) and [edge compute](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/caching-static-and-dynamic-content/) (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) to offload origin traffic during high-demand periods.
    - Configure failover pools and back up DNS with a playbook: Set up [Cloudflare Load Balancer failover pools](/reference-architecture/architectures/load-balancing) to automatically redirect traffic to healthy origins if one fails. Export DNS records for safekeeping and prepare a clear [incident response plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/preventing-downtime) that includes steps for re-routing or recovery.
- Review and update your current users' access
- Check your domain registry validity
