In this video, we discuss Cloudflare One, our Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platform and how it has been designed to revolutionize the corporate network and enable companies with their Zero Trust strategy. Legacy network design is struggling to address today's challenges of security, performance and monitoring needs.
