In this video, Jess Liu walks us through the main features of Cloudflare's China Network. They cover how the China Network works, including integrated caching, in-country China name servers, and compliance with ICP regulations. They also briefly discuss Cloudflare’s CDN Global Acceleration (formerly China Express), an option for accelerating dynamic content that cannot be cached.
