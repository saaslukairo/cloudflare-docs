To create your Email security account, you will need the alphanumeric string on the URL when logged in to the Cloudflare dashboard.

Once you have created your [Cloudflare account](/learning-paths/cybersafe/account-creation/create-cloudflare-account/), your account team will create an Email security account for you.

To establish your tenant, you will need the following information:

- Average monthly inbound message volume
- Number of active email users
- At least one domain
