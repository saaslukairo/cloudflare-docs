  label: mTLS with Cloudflare
---

In this implementation guide we will be focusing on the L7 / Application Layer security for HTTP/S requests targeting [proxied](/dns/proxy-status/) hostnames, including the [first connection](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) between client and Cloudflare.

Some common mTLS use cases are:

- Protect and verify legitimate API traffic by verifying Client Certificates provided during TLS/SSL handshakes.
- Check IoT devices' identity by verifying Client Certificates they provide during TLS/SSL handshakes.

There are two main ways to use mTLS at Cloudflare, either by using the Application Security offering (optionally including [API Shield](/api-shield/)) or [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/). Below is a non-exhaustive overview table of their differences:
