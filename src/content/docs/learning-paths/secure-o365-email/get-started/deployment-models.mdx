While there are multiple deployment methods, the easiest way to get started with Email security is via the API deployment method.

When you choose the [API deployment](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/), Email security can both scan and take actions on emails after they have reached a user's inbox.

With a [Journaling setup](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/m365-journaling/) alone without API integration, Email security can only scan emails after it has reached a user's inbox.
