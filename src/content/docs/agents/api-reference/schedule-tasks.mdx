An Agent can schedule tasks to be run in the future by calling `this.schedule(when, callback, data)`, where `when` can be a delay, a `Date`, or a cron string; `callback` the function name to call, and `data` is an object of data to pass to the function.

Scheduled tasks can do anything a request or message from a user can: make requests, query databases, send emails, read+write state: scheduled tasks can invoke any regular method on your Agent.

### Scheduling tasks

You can call `this.schedule` within any method on an Agent, and schedule tens-of-thousands of tasks per individual Agent:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
import { Agent } from "agents"

export class SchedulingAgent extends Agent {
	async onRequest(request) {
		// Handle an incoming request
		// Schedule a task 10 minutes from now
		// Calls the "checkFlights" method
		let { taskId } = await this.schedule(600, "checkFlights", { flight: "DL264", date: "2025-02-23" });
		return Response.json({ taskId });
	}

	async checkFlights(data) {
		// Invoked when our scheduled task runs
		// We can also call this.schedule here to schedule another task
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

:::caution

Tasks that set a callback for a method that does not exist will throw an exception: ensure that the method named in the `callback` argument of `this.schedule` exists on your `Agent` class.

:::

You can schedule tasks in multiple ways:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
// schedule a task to run in 10 seconds
let task = await this.schedule(10, "someTask", { message: "hello" });

// schedule a task to run at a specific date
let task = await this.schedule(new Date("2025-01-01"), "someTask", {});

// schedule a task to run every 10 minutes
let { id } = await this.schedule("*/10 * * * *", "someTask", { message: "hello" });

// schedule a task to run every 10 minutes, but only on Mondays
let task = await this.schedule("*/10 * * * 1", "someTask", { message: "hello" });

// cancel a scheduled task
this.cancelSchedule(task.id);
```

</TypeScriptExample>

Calling `await this.schedule` returns a `Schedule`, which includes the task's randomly generated `id`. You can use this `id` to retrieve or cancel the task in the future. It also provides a `type` property that indicates the type of schedule, for example, one of `"scheduled" | "delayed" | "cron"`.

:::note[Maximum scheduled tasks]

Each task is mapped to a row in the Agent's underlying [SQLite database](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/), which means that each task can be up to 2 MB in size. The maximum number of tasks must be `(task_size * tasks) + all_other_state < maximum_database_size` (currently 1GB per Agent).

### Managing scheduled tasks

You can get, cancel and filter across scheduled tasks within an Agent using the scheduling API:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
// Get a specific schedule by ID
// Returns undefined if the task does not exist
let task = await this.getSchedule(task.id)

// Get all scheduled tasks
// Returns an array of Schedule objects
let tasks = this.getSchedules();

// Cancel a task by its ID
// Returns true if the task was cancelled, false if it did not exist
await this.cancelSchedule(task.id);

// Filter for specific tasks
// e.g. all tasks starting in the next hour
let tasks = this.getSchedules({
	timeRange: {
		start: new Date(Date.now()),
		end: new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000),
	}
});
```

</TypeScriptExample>
