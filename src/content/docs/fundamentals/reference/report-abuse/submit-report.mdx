## View submitted reports

Users with Admin, Super Admin, or Trust & Safety roles can view any abuse reports submitted and accepted against the content associated with their account.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Abuse reports** page.

    <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/abuse-reports" />

2. Optionally, filter the reports based on date, report status, report type, and domain.

## Receive notifications

You can enable Trust & Safety notifications for your account for information about new blocks, removed blocks, or updates related to content. 

For help setting up alerts, refer to [Configure Cloudflare notifications](/notifications/get-started/).
