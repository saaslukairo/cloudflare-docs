Once you have [gathered the required data](/fundamentals/account/account-security/scim-setup/#gather-the-required-data), the following steps will be required to finish the provisioning with Okta.

## Set up your Okta SCIM application

1. In the Okta dashboard, go to **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Select **Browse App Catalog**.
3. Locate and select **SCIM 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)**.
4. Select **Add Integration** and name your integration.
5. Enable the following options:
   - **Do not display application icon to users**
   - **Do not display application icon in the Okta Mobile App**
6. Disable **Automatically log in when user lands on login page**.
7. Select **Next**, then select **Done**.

## Integrate the Cloudflare API

:::note
The **Update User Attributes** option is not supported.
:::

1. In your integration page, go to **Provisioning** > **Configure API Integration**.
2. Enable **Enable API Integration**.
3. In SCIM 2.0 Base URL, enter: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<accountID>/scim/v2`, substituting `accountID` for your [Cloudflare Account ID](/fundamentals/account/account-security/scim-setup/#get-your-account-id).
4. In the **OAuth Bearer Token** field, enter your API token value.
5. Deselect **Import Groups**.

## Configure user & group sync in Okta

1. In **Provisioning to App**, select **Edit**.
2. Enable **Create Users** and **Deactivate Users**. Select **Save**.
3. Select **Done**.
4. In the Assignments tab, add the users you want to synchronize with Cloudflare dashboard. You can add users in batches by assigning a group. If a user is removed from the application assignment via either direct user assignment or removed from the group that was assigned to the app, this will trigger a deprovisioning event from Okta to Cloudflare.
5. In the Push Groups tab, add the Okta groups you want to synchronize with Cloudflare dashboard. View these Okta groups in the dashboard under Manage Account > Manage members > Members > User Groups.

To verify the integration, select **View Logs** in the Okta SCIM application, and check the Audit Logs in the Cloudflare dashboard by navigating to **Manage Account** > **Audit Log**.

This will provision all of the users in the group(s) affected to your Cloudflare account with "minimal account access."
