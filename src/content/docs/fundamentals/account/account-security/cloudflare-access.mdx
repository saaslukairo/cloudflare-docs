Occasionally, you may want to allow edit access to your Account Team. A typical use case might be migrating a complex or sensitive domain over to Cloudflare.

By default, Cloudflare does not have edit access to your account.

To enable editing access by your Account Team:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Configurations** page. (You must be logged in as a **Super Administrator**).

    <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/configurations" />

2. For **Editing Permission**, switch the toggle to **On**.
3. Select a duration.
4. Click **Approve**.

:::note


In an emergency, Cloudflare Support can override your **Editing Permissions** and make updates to your account, but your Super Administrator will receive an email and the action will be recorded in your [Audit Logs](/fundamentals/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/) with an **Action** of **Break glass**.
