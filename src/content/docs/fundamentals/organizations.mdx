## Analytics & Logs

Review incoming HTTP traffic for all domains connected to Cloudflare through your organization. The data includes traffic for proxied hostnames, does not reflect your billable usage, and may be based on an adaptive sample.

You can also view specific data associated with your HTTP traffic by adding optional filters. You can also choose to print a report of your data or download the data.
