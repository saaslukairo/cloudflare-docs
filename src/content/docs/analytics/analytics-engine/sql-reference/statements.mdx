## SHOW TABLES statement

`SHOW TABLES` can be used to list the tables on your account. The table name is the name you specified as `dataset` when configuring the workers binding (refer to [Get started with Workers Analytics Engine](/analytics/analytics-engine/get-started/), for more information). The table is automatically created when you write event data in your worker.

```sql
SHOW TABLES
[FORMAT <format>]
```

Refer to [FORMAT clause](#format-clause) for the available `FORMAT` options.

## SHOW TIMEZONES statement

`SHOW TIMEZONES` can be used to list all of the timezones supported by the SQL API. Most common timezones are supported.

```sql
SHOW TIMEZONES
[FORMAT <format>]
```

## SHOW TIMEZONE statement

`SHOW TIMEZONE` responds with the current default timezone in use by SQL API. This should always be `Etc/UTC`.

```sql
SHOW TIMEZONE
[FORMAT <format>]
```

## SELECT statement

`SELECT` is used to query tables.

Usage:

```sql
SELECT <expression_list>
[FROM <table>|(<subquery>)]
[WHERE <expression>]
[GROUP BY <expression>, ...]
[ORDER BY <expression_list>]
[LIMIT <n>|ALL]
[FORMAT <format>]
```

Below you can find the syntax of each clause. Refer to the [SQL API](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/) documentation for some example queries.

### SELECT clause

The `SELECT` clause specifies the list of columns to be included in the result.
Columns can be aliased using the `AS` keyword.

Usage:

```sql
SELECT <expression> [AS <alias>], ...
```

Examples:

```sql
-- return the named columns
SELECT blob2, double3

-- return all columns
SELECT *

-- alias columns to more descriptive names
SELECT
    blob2 AS probe_name,
    double3 AS temperature
```

Additionally, expressions using supported functions and [operators](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/operators/) can be used in place of column names:

```sql
SELECT
    blob2 AS probe_name,
    double3 AS temp_c,
    double3*1.8+32 AS temp_f -- compute a value

SELECT
    blob2 AS probe_name,
    if(double3 <= 0, 'FREEZING', 'NOT FREEZING') AS description -- use of functions

SELECT
    blob2 AS probe_name,
    avg(double3) AS avg_temp -- aggregation function
```

### FROM clause

`FROM` is used to specify the source of the data for the query.

Usage:

```sql
FROM <table_name>|(subquery)
```

Examples:

```sql
-- query data written to a workers dataset called "temperatures"
FROM temperatures

-- use a subquery to manipulate the table
FROM (
    SELECT
        blob1 AS probe_name,
        count() as num_readings
    FROM
        temperatures
    GROUP BY
        probe_name
)
```

Note that queries can only operate on a single table. `UNION`, `JOIN` etc. are not currently supported.

### WHERE clause

`WHERE` is used to filter the rows returned by a query.

Usage:

```sql
WHERE <condition>
```

`<condition>` can be any expression that evaluates to a boolean.

[Comparison operators](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/operators/#comparison-operators) can be used to compare values and [boolean operators](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/operators/#boolean-operators) can be used to combine conditions.

Expressions containing functions and [operators](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/operators/#supported-operators) are supported.

Examples:

```sql
-- simple comparisons
WHERE blob1 = 'test'
WHERE double1 = 4

-- inequalities
WHERE double1 > 4

-- use of operators (see below for supported operator list)
WHERE double1 + double2 > 4
WHERE blob1 = 'test1' OR blob2 = 'test2'

-- expression using inequalities, functions and operators
WHERE if(unit = 'f', (temp-32)/1.8, temp) <= 0
```

### GROUP BY clause

When using aggregate functions, `GROUP BY` specifies the groups over which the aggregation is run.

Usage:

```sql
GROUP BY <expression>, ...
```

For example, if you had a table of temperature readings:

```sql
-- return the average temperature for each probe
SELECT
    blob1 AS probe_name,
    avg(double1) AS average_temp
FROM temperature_readings
GROUP BY probe_name
```

In the usual case the `<expression>` can just be a column name but it is also possible to supply a complex expression here. Multiple expressions or column names can be supplied separated by commas.

### ORDER BY clause

`ORDER BY` can be used to control the order in which rows are returned.

Usage:

```sql
ORDER BY <expression> [ASC|DESC], ...
```

`<expression>` can just be a column name.

`ASC` or `DESC` determines if the ordering is ascending or descending. `ASC` is the default, and can be omitted.

Examples:

```sql
-- order by double2 then double3, both in ascending order
ORDER BY double2, double3

-- order by double2 in ascending order then double3 is descending order
ORDER BY double2, double3 DESC
```

### LIMIT clause

`LIMIT` specifies a maximum number of rows to return.

Usage:

```sql
LIMIT <n>|ALL
```

Supply the maximum number of rows to return or `ALL` for no restriction.

For example:

```sql
LIMIT 10 -- return at most 10 rows
```

### OFFSET clause

`OFFSET` specifies a number of rows to skip in the query result.

Usage:

```sql
OFFSET <n>
```

For example:

```sql
OFFSET 10 -- skip the first 10 result rows
```

### FORMAT clause

`FORMAT` controls how to the returned data is encoded.

Usage:

```sql
FORMAT [JSON|JSONEachRow|TabSeparated]
```

If no format clause is included then the default format of `JSON` will be used.

Override the default by setting a format. For example:

```sql
FORMAT JSONEachRow
```

The following formats are supported:

#### JSON

Data is returned as a single JSON object with schema data included:

```json
{
    "meta": [
        {
            "name": "<column 1 name>",
            "type": "<column 1 type>"
        },
        {
            "name": "<column 2 name>",
            "type": "<column 2 type>"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "data": [
        {
            "<column 1 name>": "<column 1 value>",
            "<column 2 name>": "<column 2 value>",
            ...
        },
        {
            "<column 1 name>": "<column 1 value>",
            "<column 2 name>": "<column 2 value>",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ],
    "rows": 10
}
```

#### JSONEachRow

Data is returned with a separate JSON object per row. Rows are newline separated and there is no header line or schema data:

```json
{"<column 1 name>": "<column 1 value>", "<column 2 name>": "<column 2 value>"}
{"<column 1 name>": "<column 1 value>", "<column 2 name>": "<column 2 value>"}
...
```

#### TabSeparated

Data is returned with newline separated rows. Columns are separated with tabs. There is no header.

```txt
column 1 value  column 2 value
column 1 value  column 2 value
...
```
