AI Crawl Control metrics provide you with insight on how AI crawlers are interacting with your website ([Cloudflare zone](/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones)).

To view AI Crawl Control metrics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ai" />

You can find meaningful information across both **Crawlers** and **Metrics** tabs.

## View AI crawler activity

The **Crawlers** tab provides you with the following information:

| Metric                  | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total requests**      | Total number of requests to crawl your website from common AI crawlers. |
| **Requests by crawler** | Number of requests made by each AI crawler.                             |

## View AI Crawl Control metrics

The **Metrics** tab provides you with the following metrics to help you understand how AI crawlers are interacting with your website.

### Track successful crawler requests over time

Visualize successful crawler activity patterns over time using the **Successful requests over time** chart, which shows requests with status codes 200-300. You can group data by different dimensions to get more specific insights:

| Dimension    | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crawler**  | Track activity from individual AI crawlers (like GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and Bytespider).        |
| **Category** | Analyze crawlers by their purpose or type.                                                  |
| **Operator** | Discover which companies (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and ByteDance) are crawling your site. |
| **Host**     | Break down activity across multiple subdomains.                                             |

### Monitor status code distribution

The **Status code distribution** chart shows HTTP response codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) for AI crawler requests over time. This provides detailed visibility beyond the sparkline charts shown in the **Crawlers** tab.

The chart displays:

- Total request counts for each status code category (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
- Time series visualization showing status code trends over your selected time period
- Filtering by crawler, category, operator, and time range

Use this chart to identify patterns in how your site responds to AI crawlers in areas such as the distribution of error codes or the volume of redirects.

### Understand what content is crawled

The **Most popular paths** table shows you which pages on your site are most frequently requested by AI crawlers. This can help you understand what content is most popular with different AI models.

| Column               | Description                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Path**             | The path of the page on your website that was requested.                |
| **Hostname**         | The hostname of the requested page.                                     |
| **Crawler**          | The name of the AI crawler that made the request.                       |
| **Operator**         | The company that operates the AI crawler.                               |
| **Allowed requests** | The number of times the path was successfully requested by the crawler. |

You can also filter the results by path or content type to narrow down your analysis.

## Filter and export data
