Once you have enabled pay per crawl and set a price, you can specify which AI crawlers to charge for accessing your content.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ai" />

2. Go to the **Crawlers** tab.
3. For each crawler, choose an action from the **Actions** column:
   - **Charge**: Charge the set price for successful content access
   - **Allow**: Allow free access without charging
   - **Block**: Block access completely
</Steps>

:::tip[Search Engine Crawlers and SEO]
Use the **Category** column to identify which bots are **Search Engine Crawlers**. Setting these crawlers to **Block** or **Charge** may negatively impact your site's SEO performance, as search engines may not be able to properly index your content.
