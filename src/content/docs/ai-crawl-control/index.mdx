</Description>

AI companies use web content to train their models and power AI applications. AI Crawl Control (formerly AI Audit) gives you visibility into which AI services are accessing your content, and provides tools to manage access according to your preferences.

With AI Crawl Control, you can:

- **See which AI services access your content** - Monitor the dashboard to see crawler activity and request patterns
- **Control access with granular policies** - Set allow or block rules for individual crawlers
- **Monitor robots.txt compliance** - Track which crawlers follow your directives and create enforcement rules
- **Explore monetization options** - Set up pay per crawl pricing for content access [(private beta)](/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/)
- **Deploy with zero configuration** - Works automatically on all Cloudflare plans
