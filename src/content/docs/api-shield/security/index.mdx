## Example Cloudflare solutions

Cloudflare's API Shield — together with other compatible Cloudflare products — helps protect your API from the issues detailed in the [OWASP® API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/).

The following table provides examples of how you might match Cloudflare products to OWASP vulnerabilities:
