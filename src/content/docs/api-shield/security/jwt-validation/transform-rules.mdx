    content: Enhance Transform Rules with JWT claims

import { Steps, DashButton } from "~/components"

You can forward information from a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/) to the origin in a header by creating [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/) using claims that Cloudflare has verified via the JSON Web Token.

Claims are available through the `http.request.jwt.claims` firewall fields.

For example, the following expression will extract the user claim from a token processed by the token configuration with `TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID`:

```txt
lookup_json_string(http.request.jwt.claims["<TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID>"][0], "claim_name")
```

Refer to [Configure JWT validation](/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/api/) for more information about creating a token configuration.

## Create a Transform Rule

As an example, to send the `x-send-jwt-claim-user` request header to the origin, you must create a Transform Rule:

<Steps>
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Rules overview** page.

    <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview" />
2. Select **Create rule** > **Request Header Transform Rules**.
3. Enter a rule name and a filter expression, if applicable.
4. Choose **Set dynamic**.
5. Set the header name to `x-send-jwt-claim-user`.
6. Set the value to:
    ```txt wrap
    lookup_json_string(http.request.jwt.claims["<TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID>"][0], "claim_name")
    ```
    `<TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID>` is your token configuration ID found in JWT validation and `claim_name` is the JWT claim you want to add to the header.
