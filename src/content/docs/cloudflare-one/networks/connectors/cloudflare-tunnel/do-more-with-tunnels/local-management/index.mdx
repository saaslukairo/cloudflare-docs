A locally-managed tunnel is a Cloudflare Tunnel created by running `cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>` on the command line. Tunnel configuration is stored in your local [cloudflared directory](#default-cloudflared-directory).

:::note
Cloudflare recommends setting up a [remotely-managed tunnel](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/). Remotely-managed configurations are stored on Cloudflare, which allows you to manage the tunnel from any machine using the dashboard, API, or Terraform.
