The following policies are commonly used to secure DNS traffic.

Refer to the [DNS policies page](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/dns-policies/) for a comprehensive list of other selectors, operators, and actions.

## Allow corporate domains

This policy allows users to access official corporate domains. By deploying the policy with high [order of precedence](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/order-of-enforcement/#order-of-precedence), you ensure that employees can access trusted domains even if they fall under a blocked category like _Newly seen domains_ or _Login pages_.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

| Selector | Operator | Value             | Action | Precedence |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------ | ---------- |

## Block security threats

Block [security categories](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/domain-categories/#security-categories) such as Command & Control, Botnet and Malware based on Cloudflare's threat intelligence.

<Render
	file="gateway/policies/dash-plus-api/dns/block-security-categories"
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>

## Block content categories

The categories included in this policy are not always a security threat, but blocking them can help minimize the risk that your organization is exposed to. For more information, refer to [domain categories](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/domain-categories/).

<Render
	file="gateway/policies/dash-plus-api/dns/block-content-categories"
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>

## Block a dynamic list of categories

You can add a list of category IDs to the [EDNS header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891) of a request sent to Gateway as a JSON object using OPT code `65050`. For example:

```json
{
	"categories": [2, 67, 125, 133]
}
```

With the [Request Context Categories](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/dns-policies/#request-context-categories) selector, you can block the category IDs sent with EDNS. This is useful to filter by categories not known at the time of creating a policy, or to enforce device-specific DNS content filtering without reaching your account limit. When Gateway uses this selector to block a DNS query, the request will return an Extended DNS Error (EDE) Code 15 - Blocked error, along with a field containing an array of the matched categories.

## Block banned countries

You can implement policies to block websites hosted in countries categorized as high risk. The designation of such countries may result from your organization's customers or through the implementation of regulations including [EAR](https://www.tradecompliance.pitt.edu/embargoed-and-sanctioned-countries), [OFAC](https://orpa.princeton.edu/export-controls/sanctioned-countries), and [ITAR](https://www.tradecompliance.pitt.edu/embargoed-and-sanctioned-countries).

## Block top-level domains

Blocking [frequently misused](https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/tlds/) top-level domains (TLDs) can reduce security risks, especially when there is no discernible advantage to be gained from allowing access. Similarly, restricting access to specific country-level TLDs may be necessary to comply with regulations like [ITAR](https://www.tradecompliance.pitt.edu/embargoed-and-sanctioned-countries) or [OFAC](https://orpa.princeton.edu/export-controls/sanctioned-countries).

## Block phishing attacks

To protect against [sophisticated phishing attacks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/), you could prevent users from accessing phishing domains that are specifically targeting your organization. The following policy blocks specific keywords associated with an organization or its authentication services (such as _okta_, _2fa_, _cloudflare_ or _sso_), while still allowing access to official corporate domains.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

| Selector | Operator      | Value                                       | Logic | Action |

| Domain   | not in list   | _Corporate Domains_                         | And   | Block  |
| Domain   | matches regex | `.*okta.*\|.*cloudflare.*\|.*mfa.*\|.sso.*` |       |        |

## Block online tracking

To safeguard user privacy, some organizations will block tracking domains such as `dig.whatsapp.com` as well as other tracking domains embedded at the OS level. This policy is implemented by creating a custom blocklist. Refer to [this repository](https://github.com/nextdns/native-tracking-domains/tree/28991a0d5b2ab6d35588a74af82162ea7caff420/domains) for a list of widespread tracking domains that you can add to your blocklist.

## Block malicious IPs

Block specific IP addresses that are known to be malicious or pose a threat to your organization. This policy is usually implemented by creating custom blocklists or by using blocklists provided by threat intelligence partners or regional Computer Emergency and Response Teams (CERTs).

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

| Selector    | Operator | Value     | Action |

## Turn on CIPA filter

The CIPA (Children's Internet Protection Act) Filter is a collection of subcategories that encompass a wide range of topics that could be harmful or inappropriate for minors. It is used as a part of [Project Cybersafe Schools](/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/cybersafe/) to block access to unwanted or harmful online content. Upon creating this policy, your organization will have minimum [CIPA compliance](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act).

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

| Selector           | Operator | Value         | Action |

## Hide explicit search results

SafeSearch is a feature of search engines that helps you filter explicit or offensive content. You can force SafeSearch on search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex, YouTube, and DuckDuckGo:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

| Selector           | Operator | Value            | Action      |

	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Restrict access to specific groups

Filter DNS queries to allow only specific users access.

The following example includes two policies. The first policy allows the specified group, while the second policy blocks all other users. To ensure the policies are evaluated properly, place the Allow policy above the Block policy. For more information, refer to the [order of precedence](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/order-of-enforcement/#order-of-precedence).

### 1. Allow a group

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

| Selector           | Operator | Value             | Logic | Action |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Content Categories | in       | _Social Networks_ | And   | Allow  |
| User Group Names   | in       | `Marketing`       |       |        |

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="API">

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/rules"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		name: "Allow social media for Marketing",
		description:
			"Allow access to social media sites for users in the Marketing group",
		precedence: 1,
		enabled: true,
		action: "allow",
		filters: ["dns"],
		traffic: "any(dns.content_category[*] in {149})",
		identity: 'any(identity.groups.name[*] in {"Marketing"})',
	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### 2. Block all other users

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

| Selector           | Operator | Value             | Action |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------------- | ------ |

		action: "block",
		filters: ["dns"],
		traffic: "any(dns.content_category[*] in {149})",
		identity: "",
	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Control IP version

Enterprise users can pair these policies with an [egress policy](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/egress-policies/) to control which IP version is used to egress to the origin server.

Optionally, you can use the Domain selector to control the IP version for specific sites.

:::note
To ensure traffic routes through your preferred IP version, turn off **Modify Gateway block behavior**.
