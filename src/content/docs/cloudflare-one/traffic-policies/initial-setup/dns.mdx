Secure Web Gateway allows you to inspect DNS traffic and control which websites users can visit.

:::note
For a more detailed guide to filtering DNS queries and other traffic for your organization, refer to the [Secure your Internet traffic and SaaS apps](/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/concepts/) implementation guide.
:::

## 1. Connect to Gateway

### Connect devices

To filter DNS requests from an individual device such as a laptop or phone:

1. [Install the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/) on your device.
2. In the WARP client Settings, log in to your organization's <GlossaryTooltip term="team name">Zero Trust instance</GlossaryTooltip>.
3. (Optional) If you want to display a [custom block page](/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/custom-pages/gateway-block-page/), [install a Cloudflare root certificate](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/) on your device.

### Connect DNS locations

To filter DNS requests from a location such as an office or data center:

1. [Add the location](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/agentless/dns/locations/) to your Cloudflare One settings.
2. On your router, browser, or OS, forward DNS queries to the address shown in the location setup UI.

:::note

Gateway identifies locations differently depending on the DNS query protocol:

- **IPv4 queries** match to the source IP address. Under **Gateway** > **DNS locations**, ensure that the **Source IPv4 Address** parameter is correct for the location you want to apply policies to.
- **IPv6, DOT, or DOH queries** match to the unique DNS forwarding address assigned to the DNS location. Ensure that your DNS resolver is configured for the location you want to apply policies to.

## 2. Verify device connectivity

To verify your device is connected to Cloudflare One:

<Render
	file="gateway/verify-connectivity"
	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ one: "DNS", two: "queries" }}
/>

## 3. Create your first DNS policy

To create a new DNS policy:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Traffic policies** > **Firewall policies**.
2. In the **DNS** tab, select **Add a policy**.
3. Name the policy.
4. Under **Traffic**, build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to allow or block.
5. Choose an **Action** to take when traffic matches the logical expression. For example, we recommend adding a policy to block all [security categories](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/domain-categories/#security-categories):
   <Render
   	file="gateway/policies/block-security-categories"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />
6. Select **Create policy**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="API">

1. [Create an API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

   | Type    | Item       | Permission |
   | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
   | Account | Zero Trust | Edit       |

2. (Optional) Configure your API environment variables to include your [account ID](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and API token.
3. Send a `POST` request to the [Create a Zero Trust Gateway rule](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/rules/methods/create/) endpoint. For example, we recommend adding a policy to block all [security categories](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/domain-categories/#security-categories):

   <APIRequest
   	path="/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/rules"
   	method="POST"
   	json={{
   		name: "Block security threats",
   		description: "Block all default Cloudflare DNS security categories",
   		precedence: 0,
   		enabled: true,
   		action: "block",
   		filters: ["dns"],
   		traffic:
   			"any(dns.security_category[*] in {68 178 80 83 176 175 117 131 134 151 153})",
   		identity: "",
   	}}
   />

   ```sh output
   {
   	 "success": true,
   	 "errors": [],
   	 "messages": []
   }
   ```

   The API will respond with a summary of the policy and the result of your request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

For more information, refer to [DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/dns-policies/).

## 4. Add optional policies

Refer to our list of [common DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/dns-policies/common-policies) for other policies you may want to create.
