You can integrate Google authentication with Cloudflare Access without a Google Workspace account. The integration allows any user with a Google account to log in (if the [Access policy](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) allows them to reach the resource). Unlike the instructions for [Google Workspace](/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/google-workspace/), the steps below will not allow you to pull group membership information from a Google Workspace account.

You do not need to be a Google Cloud Platform user to integrate Google as an identity provider with Cloudflare One. You will only need to open the Google Cloud Platform to configure IdP integration settings.

## Set up Google as an identity provider

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Platform [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Create a new project, name the project, and select **Create**.

2. On the project home page, go to **APIs & Services** and on the sidebar select **Credentials**.

3. Select **Configure Consent Screen**.

4. To configure the consent screen:
   1. Select **Get started**.
   2. Enter an **App name** and a **User support email**.
   3. Choose **External** as the Audience Type. Since this application is not being created in a Google Workspace account, any user with a Gmail address can log in.
   4. Enter your **Contact Information**. Google Cloud Platform requires an email in your account.
   5. Agree to Google's user data policy and select **Continue**.
   6. Select **Create**.

5. The OAuth overview page will load. On the OAuth overview screen, select **Create OAuth client**.

6. Choose _Web application_ as the **Application type** and give your OAuth Client ID a name.

7. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, in the **URIs** field, enter your team domain:

   ```txt
   https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com
   ```

   You can find your team name in [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) under **Settings** > **Team name**.

8. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, in the **URIs** field, enter the following URL:

   ```txt
   https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
   ```

9. After creating the OAuth client, select the OAuth client that you just created. Google will present the **OAuth Client ID** value and **Client secret** value. The client secret field functions like a password and should not be shared. Copy both the **OAuth Client ID** value and **Client secret** value.

10. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Integrations** > **Identity providers**.

11. Under **Your identity providers**, select **Add new identity provider**. Choose **Google** on the next page.

12. Input the Client ID (**App ID** in the Cloudflare dashboard) and Client Secret fields generated previously.

13. (Optional) Enable [Proof of Key Exchange (PKCE)](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/). PKCE will be performed on all login attempts.

14. Select **Save**.

## Test your connection

To test that your connection is working, go to **Integrations** > **Identity providers** and select **Test** next to Google.

## Example API Config

```json
{
	"config": {
		"client_id": "<your client id>",
		"client_secret": "<your client secret>"
	},
	"type": "google",
	"name": "my example idp"
}
```
