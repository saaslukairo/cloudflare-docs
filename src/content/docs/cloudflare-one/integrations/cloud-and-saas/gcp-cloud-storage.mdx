## Integration prerequisites

- A GCP account using Cloud Storage.
- For initial setup, access to the GCP account with permission to create a new Service Account with the scopes listed below.

## Integration permissions

For the GCP Cloud Storage integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following access scopes via a Service Account:

- `roles/viewer`
- `roles/storage.admin`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission scope, refer to the [GCP IAM roles for Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles).

## Compute account

You can connect a GCP compute account to your CASB integration to perform [Data Loss Prevention](/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/) scans within your Cloud Storage bucket and avoid data egress. CASB will scan any objects that exist in the bucket at the time of configuration.

### Add a compute account

To connect a compute account to your GCP integration:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Integrations** > **Cloud & SaaS integrations**.
2. Find and select your GCP integration.
3. Select **Open connection instructions**.
4. Follow the instructions provided to connect a new compute account.
5. Select **Refresh**.

You can only connect one compute account to an integration. To remove a compute account, select **Manage compute accounts**.

### Configure compute account scanning

Once your GCP compute account has successfully connected to your CASB integration, you can configure where and how to scan for sensitive data:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Integrations** > **Cloud & SaaS integrations**.
2. Find and select your GCP integration.
3. Select **Create new configuration**.
4. In **Resources**, choose the buckets you want to scan. Select **Continue**.
5. Choose the file types, sampling percentage, and [DLP profiles](/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/) to scan for.
6. (Optional) Configure additional settings, such as the limit of API calls over time for CASB to adhere to.
7. Select **Continue**.
8. Review the details of the scan, then select **Start scan**.

CASB will take up to one hour to begin scanning. To view the scan results, go to **Cloud & SaaS findings** > **Content Findings**.

To manage your resources, go to **Cloud & SaaS findings** > **Integrations**, then find and select your GCP integration. From here, you can pause all or individual scans, add or remove resources, and change scan settings.
