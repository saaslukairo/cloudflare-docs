4. Turn on the following API permissions:
   | Scope | Permission |
   | ----- | ---------- |
   | Hosts | Read |
   | Zero Trust Assessment | Read |
5. Select **Create**.
6. Copy the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Base URL** to a safe place.
7. Go to **Host setup and management** > **Sensor downloads** and copy your **Customer ID**.

### 2. Add CrowdStrike as a service provider

<Render
	file="posture/add-service-provider"
	params={{ provider: "Crowdstrike" }}
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>

5. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** you noted down above.
6. In **Rest API URL**, enter your **Base URL**.
7. Enter your **Customer ID**.
8. Choose a **Polling frequency** for how often Cloudflare Zero Trust should query CrowdStrike for information.
9. Select **Test and save**.

### 3. Configure the posture check

<Render
	file="posture/configure-posture-check"
	params={{ one: "Crowdstrike" }}
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>
