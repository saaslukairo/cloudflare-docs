Access for Infrastructure allows you to have granular control over how users access individual servers, clusters, or databases. By adding an infrastructure application to Cloudflare Access, you can configure how users authenticate to the resource as well as control and authorize the ports, protocols, and usernames that they can connect with. Access and command logs ensure regulatory compliance and allow for auditing of user activity in case of a security breach.

:::note
Access for Infrastructure currently only supports [SSH](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/). To connect using other protocols, [add a self-hosted private application](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/self-hosted-private-app/). For browser-based SSH, RDP, or VNC, refer to [browser-rendered terminal](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/browser-rendering/).
:::

## Prerequisites

- [Connect your infrastructure](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/) to Cloudflare using `cloudflared` or WARP Connector.
- [Deploy the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/) on user devices in Gateway with WARP mode.

## 1. Add a target

<Render
	file="access/add-target"
	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ protocol: "generic" }}
/>

## 2. Add an infrastructure application

<Render file="access/add-infrastructure-app" product="cloudflare-one" />

## 3. (Recommended) Modify order of precedence in Gateway

<Render
	file="access/modify-gateway-policy-precedence"
	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ selector: "Access Infrastructure Target", protocol: "infra" }}
/>

## 4. Configure the server

Certain protocols require configuring the server to trust connections through Access for Infrastructure. For more information, refer to the protocol-specific tutorial:

- [SSH](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/#6-configure-ssh-server)

## 5. Connect as a user

Users connect to the target's IP address using their preferred client software. The user must be logged into WARP on their device, but no other system configuration is required. You can optionally configure a [private DNS resolver](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/) to allow connections to the target's private hostname.

### Connect to different VNET

To connect to targets that are in different VNETS, users will need to [switch their connected virtual network](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/#connect-to-a-virtual-network) in the WARP client.

:::note
If a user is connected to a target in VNET-A and needs to connect to a target in VNET-B, switching their VNET will not break any existing connections to targets within VNET-A. At present, connections are maintained between VNETs.

### Display available targets

<Details header="Feature availability">

| System   | Availability | Minimum WARP version |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Windows  | ✅           | 2024.9.346.0         |
| macOS    | ✅           | 2024.9.346.0         |
| Linux    | ✅           | 2024.9.346.0         |
| iOS      | ❌           |                      |

| ChromeOS | ❌           |                      |

</Details>

Users can use `warp-cli` to display a list of targets they can access. On the WARP device, open a terminal and run the following command:

<Render file="tunnel/warp-cli-target-list" product="cloudflare-one" />

You can optionally add flags to filter the output. For example:

```sh
warp-cli target list --attribute hostname=do-target --username root
```

To view all available filters, type `warp-cli target list --help`.

## Revoke a user's session

To revoke a user's access to all infrastructure targets, you can either [revoke the user from Zero Trust](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/#per-user) or revoke their device. Cloudflare does not currently support revoking a user's session for a specific target.

## Infrastructure policy selectors

The following [Access policy selectors](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/#selectors) are available for securing infrastructure applications:

- Email
- Emails ending in
- SAML group
- Country
- Authentication method
- Device posture
- Entra group, GitHub organization, Google Workspace group, Okta group
