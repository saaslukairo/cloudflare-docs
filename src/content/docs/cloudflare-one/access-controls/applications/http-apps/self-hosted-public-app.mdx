You can securely publish internal tools and applications by adding Cloudflare Access as an authentication layer between the end user and your origin server.

This guide covers how to make a web application accessible to anyone on the Internet via a public hostname. If you would like to make the application available over a private IP or hostname, refer to [Add a self-hosted private application](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/self-hosted-private-app/).

## Prerequisites

- An [active domain on Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/)
- Domain uses either a [full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) or a [partial (`CNAME`) setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/)

## 1. Add your application to Access

<Render
	file="access/self-hosted-app/generic-public-app"
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>

## 2. Connect your origin to Cloudflare

[Set up a Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) to publish your internal application. Only users who match your Access policies will be granted access.

:::note
We recommend [creating an Access application](#1-add-your-application-to-access) before setting up the tunnel route. If you do not have an Access application in place, the published application will be available to anyone on the Internet.
:::

If your application is already publicly routable, a Tunnel is not strictly required. However, you will then need to protect your origin IP using [other methods](/fundamentals/security/protect-your-origin-server/).

## 3. Validate the Access token

<Render file="access/secure-tunnel-with-access" product="cloudflare-one" />

Users can now connect to your self-hosted application after authenticating with Cloudflare Access.

## Product compatibility

<Render
	file="access/self-hosted-app/product-compatibility"
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>
