This guide covers how to configure [Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/topic/7579248?ref_topic=7556686&sjid=14539485562330725560-NA) as a SAML application in Cloudflare One.

:::note

The integration of Access as a single sign-on provider for your Google Workspace account does not work for Google super admins. It will work for other users.

:::

## Prerequisites

- An [identity provider](/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/) configured in Cloudflare One
- Admin access to a Google Workspace account

## 1. Create an application in Cloudflare One

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Access controls** > **Applications**.

2. Select **Add an application**.

3. Select **SaaS**.

4. Fill in the following information:
   - **Application**: _Google_.
   - **Entity ID**: Use the value provided to you by Google when [configuring your SAML SSO provider](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Enable-SAML-2.0-in-Google-Apps.html).
   - **Assertion Consumer Service URL**: `https://www.google.com/a/<your_domain.com>/acs`, where `<your_domain.com>` is your Google Workspace domain.
   - **Name ID Format**: _Email_.

:::caution

When you put your Google Workspace behind Access, users will not be able to log in using [Google](/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/google/) or [Google Workspace](/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/google-workspace/) as an identity provider. To secure Google Workspace behind Access and avoid an [authentication loop](/cloudflare-one/faq/troubleshooting/#after-putting-google-workspace-behind-access-i-cant-log-in-it-keeps-redirecting-between-access-and-google-without-ever-completing-authentication), you must configure a different identity provider (not Google or Google Workspace) for authentication.
:::

5. [Create an Access policy](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) for your application. For example, you could allow users with an `@your_domain.com` email address.

6. Copy the **SSO endpoint**, **Access Entity ID or Issuer**, and **Public key**. These values will be used to configure Google Workspace.

7. Save the application.

## 2. Create a certificate from your public key

1. Copy and then paste your **Public key** into a text editor.

2. Wrap the certificate in `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. For example,

   ```txt
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <PUBLIC_KEY>
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```

3. Set the file extension as `.crt` and save.

## 3. Create an SSO provider in Google Workspace

1. Log in to your [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/).
2. Go to **Security** > **Authentication** > **SSO with third party IdP**.
3. Select **Third-party SSO profile for your organization**.
4. Enable **Set up SSO with third-party identity provider**.
5. Fill in the following information:
   - **Sign-in page URL**: Copy and then paste your **SSO endpoint** from Cloudflare One.
   - **Sign-out page URL**: `https://<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/logout`, where `<team-name>` is your Cloudflare One <GlossaryTooltip term="team name">team name</GlossaryTooltip>.
   - **Verification certificate**: Upload the certificate file containing your public key.
6. (Optional) Enable **Use a domain specific issuer**. If you select this option, Google will send an issuer specific to your Google Workspace domain (`google.com/a/<your_domain.com>` instead of the standard `google.com`).

## 4. Test the integration

1. In your [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/), go to **Apps** > **Google Workspace** > **Gmail** > **Setup**.
2. Copy your Gmail **Web address**.
3. Open an incognito browser window and go to your Gmail web address (for example, `https://mail.google.com/a/<your_domain.com>`).

An Access login screen should appear.

## Troubleshooting

`Error: "G Suite - This account cannot be accessed because the login credentials could not be verified."`

If you see this error, it is likely that the public key and private key do not match. Confirm that your certificate file includes the correct public key.
