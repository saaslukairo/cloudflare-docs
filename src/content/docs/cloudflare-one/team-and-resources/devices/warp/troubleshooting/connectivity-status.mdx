The WARP client GUI displays the following status messages when transitioning from a **Disconnected** to **Connected** state. These messages indicate the connectivity stage of the WARP daemon as it establishes a connection from the device to Cloudflare. The [WARP mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/) determines which messages are displayed during the connection process. If WARP encounters an error while connecting, the status message will change to an [error code](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/troubleshooting/client-errors/).

To print status messages to the console, run the `warp-cli -l status` command before turning on the WARP switch.

| Status message        | Description              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Verifying connection settings | Initializes connection components based on your [WARP settings](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/). |
| Validating network      | Validates Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi network connectivity. |
| Initializing IP connection | Checks for IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to Cloudflare using the [Happy Eyeballs algorithm](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6555). |
| Establishing a connection | Connects to the endpoint discovered by Happy Eyeballs. |
| Building a Tunnel | Creates a [virtual network interface](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/warp-architecture/#virtual-interface) on the operating system for the WARP tunnel. |
| Configuring the firewall | Configures the system firewall to allow WARP tunnel traffic. |
| Setting up your routing table | Updates the [system routing table](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/warp-architecture/#routing-table) based on your [Split Tunnel rules](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/). |
| Configuring your firewall rules | Configures the [system firewall](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/warp-architecture/#system-firewall) based on your Split Tunnel rules. |
| Checking connectivity to DNS| Checks connectivity to the DNS endpoint (`<account-id>.cloudflare-gateway.com`). |
| Setting local endpoint communication | Configures local DNS proxy sockets. |
| Configuring local DNS proxy | Creates a [local DNS proxy](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/warp-architecture/#dns-traffic) for DNS resolution.|
| Applying DNS settings | Sets the local DNS proxy as the default DNS server on the device. |
| Configuring forward proxy | (Only in [Proxy mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/#proxy-mode)) Configures the SOCKS proxy. |
| Confirming Tunnel connection | Checks connectivity to [destinations](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#connectivity-checks) inside and outside of the WARP tunnel. |
| Validating DNS configuration | Verifies that DNS requests are answered by WARP's local DNS proxy. |
| Verifying SOCKS proxy configuration | (Only in [Proxy mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/#proxy-mode)) Verifies the SOCKS proxy configuration. |
| Ensuring MTLS identity | (Only in [Device Information Only mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/device-information-only/)) Installs a client certificate for mTLS authentication. |
