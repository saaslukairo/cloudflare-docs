Cloudflare Zero Trust enforces WARP client reauthentication on a per-application basis, unlike legacy VPNs which treat it as a global setting. You can configure WARP session timeouts for your [Access applications](#configure-warp-sessions-in-access) or as part of your [Gateway policies](#configure-warp-sessions-in-gateway).

<Render file="warp/warp-sessions-intro" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Prerequisites

Ensure that traffic can reach your IdP and `<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com` through WARP.

## Configure WARP sessions in Gateway

<Render file="warp/warp-sessions-gateway" product="cloudflare-one" />

:::note[Enforce a global timeout]

To enforce a global reauthentication event, set each of your Network or HTTP policies to the same WARP session duration.

## Configure WARP sessions in Access <Badge text="Beta" variant="caution" size="small" />

You can allow users to log in to Access applications using their WARP session. WARP authentication is only supported for Access applications protected by Allow or Block policies.

To configure WARP sessions for Access applications:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Team & Resources** > **Devices** > **Management**.
2. In **Device enrollment permissions**, select **Manage**.
3. Go to the **Login methods** tab and enable **WARP authentication identity**.
4. Under **Session duration**, choose a session timeout value. This timeout will apply to all Access applications that have WARP authentication enabled.

:::note

This timeout value does not apply to [WARP session checks in Gateway policies](#configure-warp-sessions-in-gateway).
:::

5. (Optional) To enable WARP authentication by default for all existing and new applications, select **Apply to all Access applications**. You can override this default setting on a per-application basis when you [create](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/) or modify an Access application.
6. Select **Save**.

Users can now authenticate once with WARP and have access to your Access applications for the configured period of time. The session timer resets when the user re-authenticates with the IdP used to enroll in WARP.

## Force user interaction with IdP

If the user has an active browser session with the IdP, WARP will use the existing browser cookies to re-authenticate and the user will not be prompted to re-enter their credentials. You can override this behavior to require explicit user interaction in the IdP.

### Supported IdPs

- [Microsoft Entra ID](/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/entra-id/#force-user-interaction-during-warp-reauthentication)

## Manually reauthenticate

<Render file="warp/manually-reauth" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Limitations

- **Only one user per device** — If a device is already registered with User A, User B will not be able to log in on that device through the re-authentication flow. To switch the device registration to a different user, User A must first log out from Zero Trust (if [Allow device to leave organization](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#allow-device-to-leave-organization) is enabled), or an admin can revoke the registration from **My Team** > **Devices**. User B can then properly [enroll](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/).
- **Active connections are not terminated** — Active sessions such as SSH and RDP will remain connected beyond the timeout limit.
- **Binding Cookie is not supported** - WARP authentication will not work for Access applications that have the [Binding Cookie](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/#binding-cookie) enabled.
