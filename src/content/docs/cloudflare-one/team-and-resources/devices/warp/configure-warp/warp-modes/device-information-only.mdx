Device Information Only mode allows you to enforce device posture rules when a user connects to your [self-hosted Access application](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/). This mode relies on a client certificate generated from your account to establish trust between the Access application and the device.

## 1. Turn on account settings

Using the API, enable client certificate provisioning for [your zone](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/):

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/devices/policy/certificates"
	method="PATCH"
	json={{
		enabled: true,
	}}
/>

## 2. Configure the WARP client

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Team & Resources** > **Devices** > **Device profiles**.

2. Under **Profiles**, choose a [device profile](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/) and select **Edit**.

3. For **Service mode**, select **Device Information Only**.

4. Select **Save profile**.

5. [Enroll your device](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) into your Zero Trust organization.

   When enrolled in Device Information Only mode, the WARP client will automatically generate a client certificate and install the certificate on the device. This certificate is necessary to confirm the source of outgoing traffic.

## 3. (Optional) Verify the client certificate

1.  To view the client certificates installed on the device:

        <Tabs> <TabItem label="Windows">

        1. Open the **Start** menu and select **Run**.
        2. Enter `certlm.msc`.
        3. Go to **Personal** > **Certificates**.

        </TabItem> <TabItem label="macOS">

        1. Open **Keychain Access**.
        2. Go to **System** > **My Certificates**.

        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Linux">

        Open a terminal window and run the following command:

        ```sh
        $ certutil -L -d sql:/etc/pki/nssdb
        ```

        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="iOS">

        Go to **Settings** > **General** > **About** > **Certificate Trust Settings**.

        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Android">

        The location of the client certificate may vary depending on the Android device.

        - **Samsung**: Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Other security settings** > **View security certificates**.
        - **Google Pixel**: Go to **Security** > **Advanced settings** > **Encryption & credentials** > **Credential storage**.

        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="ChromeOS">

        Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Google Play Store** > **Manage Android Preferences** > **Security** > **Credentials**.

        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

        The client certificate name should match the **Device ID** in your WARP client **Preferences**.

2.  To verify the client certificate in your Cloudflare account:
    1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), select the zone for which you enabled client certificates.
    2. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Client Certificates**.

    The certificate name is the WARP enrollment **Device ID**.

## 4. Enforce the client certificate

To block traffic from devices that do not have a valid client certificate:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **SSL/TLS** > **Client Certificates**.
2. Under **Hosts**, select **Edit** and enter the hostname of your Access application (for example, `app.mycompany.com`). This enables mTLS authentication for the application.
3. Select **Create mTLS rule**.
4. Create a WAF custom rule that checks all requests to your application for a valid client certificate:
   | Field | Operator | Value | Logic | Action |
   | ----- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
   | Client Certificate | equals | Off | And | Block |
   | Hostname | equals | `app.mycompany.com` | | |
5. Select **Deploy**.

Device Information Only mode is now enabled on the device. To start enforcing device posture, set up a [WARP client check](/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/warp-client-checks/) and add a _Require_ device posture rule to your [Access policy](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/). When the device connects to the Access application for the first time, the browser will ask to use the client certificate installed by WARP.

## Limitations

Device Information mode is not compatible with the [Windows pre-login](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/windows-prelogin/) feature. The user must be logged into Windows because WARP needs to [install a certificate](#3-optional-verify-the-client-certificate) in the user store.
