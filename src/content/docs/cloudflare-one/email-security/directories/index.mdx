Directories are folders to store user data. Email security allows you to manage directories from the Cloudflare dashboard.

To add a directory:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) > **Email security**.
2. Select **Directories**.
3. Select **Add a directory** > **Connect an integration**.
4. Select either **Google Workspace CASB + EMAIL** or **Microsoft CASB+EMAIL**.
5. Refer to [Enable Gmail BCC integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/enable-gmail-integration/#enable-gmail-bcc-integration) if you choose Google Workspace. Refer to [Enable Microsoft integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/m365-api/#enable-microsoft-integration) if you choose Microsoft 365.

To sync a directory:

1. Locate the directory you want to sync.
2. Select the three dots, then select **Sync now**.

:::note
The **Auto sync** option is on by default. It is recommended to keep this option on at all times to ensure directories are always synchronized.
