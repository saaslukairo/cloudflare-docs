In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure Cisco IronPort with Email security as MX record.

## 1. Add a Sender Group for Email security Email Protection IPs

To add a new Sender Group:

1. Go to **Mail Policies** > **HAT Overview**.

2. Select **Add Sender Group**.

3. Configure the new Sender Group as follows:
   - **Name**: `Email security`.
   - **Order**: Order above the existing **WHITELIST** sender group.
   - **Comment**: `Email security Email Protection egress IP Addresses`.
   - **Policy**: `TRUSTED` (by default, spam detection is disabled for this mail flow policy).
   - **SBRS**: Leave blank.
   - **DNS Lists**: Leave blank.
   - **Connecting Host DNS Verification**: Leave all options unchecked.

4. Select **Submit and Add Senders** and add the IP addresses mentioned in <a href="/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/egress-ips/" target="_blank">Egress IPs</a>

## 2. Configure Incoming Relays

You need to configure the Incoming Relays section to tell IronPort to ignore upstream hops, since all the connections are now coming from Email security. This step is needed so the IronPort can retrieve the original IPs to calculate IP reputation. IronPort also uses this information in the Anti-Spam (IPAS) scoring of messages.

1. To enable the Incoming Relays Feature, select **Network** > **Incoming Relays**.
2. Select **Enable** and commit your changes.
3. Now, you will have to add an Incoming Relay. Select **Network** > **Incoming Relays**.
4. Select **Add Relay** and give your relay a name.
5. Enter the IP address of the MTA, MX, or other machine that connects to the email gateway to relay incoming messages. You can use IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
6. Specify the `Received:` header that will identify the IP address of the original external sender.
7. Commit your changes.

## 3. Disable SPF checks

Make sure you disable Sender Policy Framework (SPF) checks in IronPort. Because Email security is acting as the MX record, if you do not disable SPF checks, IronPort will block emails due to an SPF failure.

Refer to [Cisco's documentation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/email-security-appliance/117973-faq-esa-00.html) for more information on how to disable SPF checks.

## 4. Set up MX/Inline
