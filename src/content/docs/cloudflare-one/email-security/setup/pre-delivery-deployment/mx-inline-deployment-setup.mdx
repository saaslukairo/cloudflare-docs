## Prerequisites

To use Email security, you will need to have:

<Render
	file="email-security/onboarding-prerequisites"
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>

## Initiate MX/Inline configuration

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email security**.
3. Select **Overview**. Select one of the following options:

- If you have not purchased Email security, select **Contact sales**.
- If you have not associated any integration, [associate an integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/#associate-an-integration), then select **Set up**.
- If you have associated an integration, but have not connected a domain, select [**Connect a domain**](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/#connect-a-domain).

4. Select **MX/Inline**.
5. To start the MX/Inline configuration, you will need to have completed the prerequisite setup on your email provider's platform. Once you have completed this step, select **I confirm that I have completed all the necessary requirements**. Then, select **Start configuration**.

:::note
You can only onboard one domain at a time.

## Associate an integration

MX/Inline does not require an integration for protection to be effective. However, it is a best practice to connect an integration.

To associate an integration:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Integrations** > **Cloud & SaaS Integrations** > **Integrations**
2. Select **Connect an integration**.
3. Select an application: Choose between **Google Workspace CASB + EMAIL**, or **Microsoft CASB + EMAIL**.
   - Refer to [Enable Gmail BCC integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/enable-gmail-integration/#1-create-a-service-account-in-your-gcp-project) if you select **Google Workspace CASB + EMAIL**.
   - Refer to [Enable Microsoft integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/m365-api/#enable-microsoft-integration) if you select **Microsoft CASB + EMAIL**.
4. After you have associated an integration, go to **Email security** > **Set up**.
5. Follow the instructions to [connect a domain](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/#connect-a-domain).

## Connect a domain

If you have verified zones on Cloudflare, continue with the following steps:

1. **Connect a domain**: Select your domain. Then, select **Continue**.
2. **Select position**: This step allows you to choose where Email security fits into your mail flow and configure position settings:
   - **Select position**: Choose between:
     - **Sit first (hop count = 1)**: Email security is the first server that receives the email. There are no other email scanners or services between the Internet and Cloudflare.
     - **Sit in the middle (hop count > 1)**: Email security sits anywhere other than the first position. Other servers receive emails _before_ Email security. There are other email scanners or email services in between.
   - **Position settings**: Refine how Email security receives and forwards emails:
     - **Forwarding address**: This is your mail flow next hop after Email security. This value is auto-filled, but you can still change it.
     - **Outbound TLS**: Choose between:
       1. **Forward all messages over TLS** (recommended).
       2. **Forward all messages using opportunistic TLS**.
   - Select **Continue**.
3. (**Optional**, select **Skip for now** to skip this step) **Configure quarantine policy**: Select dispositions to automatically prevent certain types of incoming messages from reaching a recipient's inbox.
4. (Optional) **Update MX records**:
   - Email security can automatically update MX records for domains that proxy traffic through Cloudflare. Under **Your mail processing location**, select your mail processing location.
   - You can also choose to allow Cloudflare to update MX records by selecting **I confirm that I allow Cloudflare to update to the new MX records**. When Email security updates MX records, we replace your original MX records with Email security MX records.
   - Select **Continue**.
5. **Review details**: Review your domain, then select **Go to domains**.

## Users who do not have domains with Cloudflare

If you do not have domains with Cloudflare, the dashboard will display two options:

- [Enter domain manually](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/#enter-domain-manually).
- [Add a domain to Cloudflare](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/#add-a-domain-to-cloudflare).

## Enter domain manually

1. **Add domains**: Manually enter domain names.
2. **Review all domains**: Review all your domains, then select **Continue**.
3. **Verify your domains**: It may take up to 24 hours for your domains to be verified. Select **Done**.
4. Once your domains have been verified, the dashboard will display a message like this: **You have verified domains ready to connect to Email security**. This means that you can now set up Email security via MX/Inline.
5. Select **Set up**, then select **MX/Inline**.
6. Follow the steps to [initiate MX/Inline configuration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/#initiate-mxinline-configuration).

### Add a domain to Cloudflare

Selecting **Add a domain to Cloudflare** will redirect you to a new page where you will connect your domain to Cloudflare. Once you have entered an existing domain, select **Continue**.

Then, follow the steps to [Set up MX/Inline](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/).
