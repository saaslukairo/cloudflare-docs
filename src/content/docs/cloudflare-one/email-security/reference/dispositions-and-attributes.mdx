Email security uses a variety of factors to determine whether a given email message, domain, URL, or packet is part of a <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phishing</GlossaryTooltip> campaign. These small pattern assessments are dynamic in nature and — in many cases — no single pattern will determine the final verdict.

:::note[Detection vs. disposition]
Detection is the process Email security does to identify what threat an email may contain. An email can have multiple detections, but they will only have one and final disposition. The detections an email have will determine the disposition of the email.
:::

## Dispositions

Any traffic that flows through Email security is given a final disposition, which represents our evaluation of that specific message. Each message will receive only one disposition header, so your organization can take clear and specific actions on different message types.

You can use disposition values when [setting up auto-moves](/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/auto-moves/).

### Available values

The following disposition values follow an order of maliciousness:

<Render
	file="email-security/dispositions-and-attributes"
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>

### Header structure

When Email security adds a disposition header to an email message, that header matches the following format:

```txt
X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition: [Value]
```

Note that emails with a disposition of `SPAM` will be tagged with `UCE` (unsolicited commercial emails) in their headers:

```txt
X-CFEmailSecurity-Disposition: UCE
```

## Attributes

Traffic that flows through Email security can also receive one or more Attributes, which indicate that a specific condition has been met.

### Available values
