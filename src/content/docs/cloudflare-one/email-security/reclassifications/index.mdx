Reclassifying messages allows you to choose the disposition of your messages if the disposition is incorrect. This helps improve Email security's detection accuracy and ensures proper handling of email threats.

## Reclassify messages

To reclassify a message:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Email security** and select **Investigation**.
2. On the **Investigation** page, under **Your matching messages**, select the message you want to reclassify.
3. Select the three dots, then select **Request reclassification**.
4. Under **New disposition**, select among the following:
   - **Malicious**: Traffic invoked multiple phishing verdict triggers, met thresholds for bad behavior, and is associated with active campaigns.
   - **Spoof**: Traffic associated with phishing campaigns that is either non-compliant with your email authentication policies (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) or has mismatching Envelope From and `Header From` values.
   - **Spam**: Traffic associated with non-malicious, commercial campaigns.
   - **Bulk**: Traffic associated with [Graymail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graymail_%28email%29), that falls in between the definitions of `SPAM` and `SUSPICIOUS`. For example, a marketing email that intentionally obscures its unsubscribe link.
   - **Clean**: Traffic not associated with any phishing campaigns.
5. Select **Save**.

To reclassify messages in bulk, select **Select all messages** > **Action** > **Request reclassification**.

To release messages in bulk, select **Select all messages** > **Action** > **Release**.

## Upload EML files

Email security classifies certain emails as "Clean". If you disagree with the disposition, you can upload an EML file and reclassify the email.

On the **Investigation** page:

1. Go to the email marked as **Clean**.
2. Select the three dots > **Request reclassification**.
3. Upload the EML file.
4. Select a new disposition.
5. Select **Save**.
