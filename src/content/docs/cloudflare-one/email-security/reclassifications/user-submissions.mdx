User submissions are the emails your users submitted for reclassification. User submissions help enhance our detection model, but can be escalated for human review.

Any email that is reported as [phish](/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/phish-submissions/#reclassify-an-email) will be displayed under **User submissions**.

:::note
[PhishGuard](/cloudflare-one/email-security/phishguard/) customers can have submissions analyzed when submitting at either user or team level. Any non-PhishGuard customer can still have submissions analyzed by submitting at team level.
