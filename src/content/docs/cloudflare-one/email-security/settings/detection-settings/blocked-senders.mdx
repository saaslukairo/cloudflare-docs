Email security marks all messages from these senders with a malicious [disposition](/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).

## How blocked senders work

Blocked senders ensures messages from any sender is automatically marked as malicious, preventing them from reaching users' inbox.
