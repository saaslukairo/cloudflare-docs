With Cloudflare One, you can create lists of URLs, hostnames, or other entries to reference when creating [Gateway policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/) or [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/). This allows you to quickly create rules that match and take actions against several items at once.

Before creating a list, make note of the [limitations](#limitations).

## List types

Lists can contain a single type of data each. Supported data types include:

- URLs
- Hostnames or domains
- Serial numbers
- User email addresses
- IP addresses
- Device ID numbers

<Render file="gateway/lists" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Edit a list

1. In the **Lists** page, locate the list you want to edit.

2. Select **Edit**. This will allow you to:
   - Edit list name and description by selecting on the three-dots menu to the right of your list's name.
   - Delete the list by selecting the three-dots menu to the right of your list's name.
   - Delete individual entries.
   - Manually add entries to your list.

3. Once you have edited your list, select **Save**.

## Limitations

### List size

Your lists can include up to 1,000 entries for Standard plans and 5,000 for Enterprise plans. An uploaded CSV file must be smaller than 2 MB.

### Wildcard entries

Hostname lists do not support wildcard entries (`*.example.com`). You will need to add domains as exact matches. Adding a wildcard to lists comprised of hostnames will return an error when you save.

### Non-Latin characters

Gateway supports non-Latin characters by converting all domains and hostnames to [Punycode](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt). Once you save a list with non-Latin characters, Gateway will display the entry as Punycode.

### Duplicate entries

Lists cannot have duplicate entries. Because domains and hostnames are converted to [Punycode](#non-latin-characters), multiple list entries that convert to the same string will count as duplicates. For example, `éxàmple.com` converts to `xn—xmple-rqa5d.com`, so including both `éxàmple.com` and `xn—xmple-rqa5d.com` in a list will result in a duplicate error.

### URL slashes

### Extended email addresses

<Render file="gateway/extended-email" product="cloudflare-one" />

### API rate limit

You can send 600 requests to the [Gateway Lists](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/lists/) endpoint per minute. If you exceed the rate limit, Cloudflare will block subsequent requests for 120 seconds.
