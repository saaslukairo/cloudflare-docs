Cloudflare One can check if [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/) is running on a device to determine if a request should be allowed to reach a protected resource.

## Prerequisites

- SentinelOne agent is deployed on the device.
- <Render
  	file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed"
  	product="cloudflare-one"
  	params={{
  		name: "WARP Client Checks",
  		link: "/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/warp-client-checks/",
  	}}
  />

## Configure the SentinelOne check

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Reusable components** > **Posture checks**.

2. Go to **WARP client checks** and select **Add a check**.

3. Select **SentinelOne**.

4. You will be prompted for the following information:
   1. **Name**: Enter a unique name for this device posture check.
   2. **Operating system**: Select your operating system. You will need to configure one posture check per operating system.
   3. **Application Path**: Enter the full path to the SentinelOne process to be checked (for example, `C:\Program Files\SentinelOne\Sentinel Agent 21.7.4.1043\SentinelAgent.exe`).
      :::note
      The path of the SentinelOne process may change between updates. Make sure to edit **Application Path** to match the new path, or use `%PATH%` variables.
      :::

   4. **Signing certificate thumbprint (recommended)**: Enter the thumbprint of the publishing certificate used to sign the binary. This proves the binary came from SentinelOne and is the recommended way to validate the process.
   5. **SHA-256 (optional)**: Enter a SHA-256 value. This is used to validate the SHA256 signature of the binary and ensures the integrity of the binary file on the device. Note: do not fill out this field unless you strictly control updates to SentinelOne, as this will change between versions.

Next, go to **Insights** > **Logs** > **Posture logs** and verify that the SentinelOne check is returning the expected results.
