The Domain Joined device posture attribute ensures that a user is a member of a specific Windows Active Directory domain.

## Prerequisites

- <Render
  	file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed"
  	product="cloudflare-one"
  	params={{
  		name: "WARP Client Checks",
  		link: "/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/warp-client-checks/",
  	}}
  />

## Enable the Domain Joined check

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Reusable components** > **Posture checks**.
2. Go to **WARP client checks** and select **Add a check**.
3. Select **Domain Joined**.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the check.
5. Select your operating system.
6. Enter the domain you want to check for, such as `example.com`.
   :::note
   The **Domain** field is case-sensitive. If your domain is `example.com`, entering `Example.com` will fail the posture check.
   :::
7. Select **Save**.

Next, go to **Insights** > **Logs** > **Posture logs** and verify that the Domain Joined check is returning the expected results.

## Validate the domain value

To check the domain value on your Windows device:

1. Open a PowerShell window.
2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain
   ```

The command will return the Active Directory domain to which your device belongs.
