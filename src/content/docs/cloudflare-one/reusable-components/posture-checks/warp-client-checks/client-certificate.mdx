The Client Certificate device posture attribute checks if the device has a valid client certificate signed by a trusted certificate. The trusted certificate is uploaded to Cloudflare and specified as part of the posture check rule. The client certificate posture check can be used in Gateway and Access policies to ensure that the user is connecting from a managed device.

<sup>1</sup> Client certificate checks that ran on an earlier WARP version will continue to work. To configure a new certificate check, update WARP to the versions listed above.
</Details>

## Prerequisites

- A CA that issues client certificates for your devices. WARP does not evaluate the certificate trust chain; this needs to be the issuing certificate.

  :::note[Upload the signing certificate that issued the client certificate]

  When uploading a certificate to use in posture checks, Cloudflare does not differentiate between root and intermediate certificates. You must upload the actual signing certificate - the one that directly signed the client certificate.

  If you upload a different certificate, even if it exists higher up in the trust chain (for example, the root that issued the signing certificate), the posture check will fail.

  :::

- Cloudflare WARP client is [deployed](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/) on the device.
- A client certificate is [installed and trusted](#configure-the-client-certificate-check) on the device.

:::note

To generate a sample root CA for testing, refer to [Generate mTLS certificates](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/mutual-tls-authentication/#generate-mtls-certificates).
:::

## Configure the client certificate check

1. <Render
   	file="upload-mtls-cert"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   	params={{
   		key: "The private key is only required if you are using this custom certificate for Gateway HTTPS inspection.",
   		cert: "signing certificate",
   	}}
   />

2. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Reusable components** > **Posture checks**.

3. Go to **WARP client checks** and select **Add a check**.

4. Select **Client certificate**.

5. You will be prompted for the following information:
   1. **Name**: Enter a unique name for this device posture check.
   2. **Operating system**: Select your operating system.
   3. **OS locations**: Specify the location(s) where the client certificate is installed.
      <Details header="Windows">
      	- Local machine trust store
        - User trust store
      </Details>
      <Details header="macOS">

      - System keychain

      </Details>
      <Details header="Linux">
      	- NSSDB (`/etc/pki/nssdb`) - To search a custom location, enter the
      	absolute file path(s) to the certificate and private key (for example
      	`/usr/local/mycompany/certs/client.pem` and
      	`/usr/local/mycompany/certs/client_key.pem`). The certificate and
      	private key must be in `PEM` format. They can either be in two different
      	files or the same file.
      </Details>
   4. **Certificate ID**: Enter the UUID of the signing certificate.
   5. **Common name**: (Optional) To check for a Common Name (CN) on the client certificate, enter a string with optional `${serial_number}` and `${hostname}` variables (for example, `${serial_number}_mycompany`). WARP will search for an exact, case-insensitive match. If you do not specify a common name, WARP will ignore the common name field on the certificate.
   6. **Check for Extended Key Usage**: (Optional) Check whether the client certificate has one or more attributes set. Supported values are **Client authentication** (`1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2`) and/or **Email** (`1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4`).
   7. **Check for private key**: (Recommended) When enabled, WARP checks that the device has a private key associated with the client certificate.
   8. **Subject Alternative Name**: (Optional) To check for a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) on the client certificate, enter a string with optional `${serial_number}` and `${hostname}` variables (for example, `${serial_number}_mycompany`). WARP will search for an exact, case-insensitive match. You can add multiple SANs to the posture check — a certificate only needs to match one SAN for the check to pass.

6. Select **Save**.

Next, go to **Insights** > **Logs** > **Posture logs** and verify that the client certificate check is returning the expected results.

## Troubleshooting

You can use the following commands to check if a client certificate is properly installed and trusted on the device.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Windows">

1. Open a PowerShell window.
2. To search the local machine trust store for a certificate with a specific common name, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My\ | where{$_.Subject -like "*<COMMON_NAME>*"}
```

3. To search the user trust store for a certificate with a specific common name, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My\ | where{$_.Subject -like "*<COMMON_NAME>*"}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">

1. Open Terminal.
2. To search System Keychain for a certificate with a specific common name, run the following command:

```sh
/usr/bin/security find-certificate -c "<COMMON_NAME>" -p /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Linux">

1. Open Terminal.
2. To list all client certificates in NSSDB, run the following command:

```sh
certutil -L -d /etc/pki/nssdb
```

```sh output
Certificate Nickname                                         Trust Attributes
                                                             SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

meow                                                         CTu,Cu,Cu
noPrivateKey                                                 CT,,

```

3. Open your desired certificate using its certificate nickname. The common name will appear in the line `Subject: "CN=123456.mycompany"`.

```sh
certutil -L -d /etc/pki/nssdb -n meow
```

```sh output

For the posture check to pass, a certificate must appear in the output that validates against the uploaded signing certificate.
