Shadow IT SaaS analytics provides visibility into the SaaS applications your users are visiting. This information allows you to create identity and device-driven Cloudflare One policies to secure your users and data.

To access Shadow IT SaaS analytics:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Insights**.
2. Go to **Dashboards**.
3. Select **Shadow IT: SaaS analytics**.

## Prerequisites

To allow Cloudflare to discover shadow IT in your traffic, you must set up [HTTP filtering](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/initial-setup/http/).

## Use Shadow IT SaaS analytics

### 1. Review applications

The first step in using the Shadow IT SaaS analytics dashboard is to review applications in the [Application Library](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/app-library/). The App Library synchronizes application review statuses with approval statuses from the Shadow IT Discovery SaaS analytics dashboard.

### 2. Monitor usage

Review the Shadow IT SaaS analytics dashboard for application usage. Filter the view based on:

    | Field            | Description                                                                                                                  |
    | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Application      | SaaS application's name and logo.                                                                                            |
    | Application type | [Application type](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/application-app-types/#app-types) assigned by Cloudflare Cloudflare One.     |
    | Status           | Application's approval status.                                                                           |
    | Secured          | Whether the application is currently secured behind Cloudflare Access.                                                       |
    | Users            | Number of users who connected to the application over the period of time specified on the Shadow IT Discovery overview page. |

To manage application statuses in bulk, select **Set Application Statuses** to review applications your users commonly visit and update their approval statuses.

### 3. Create policies

After marking applications, you can create [HTTP policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/) based on application review status. For example, you can create policies that:

- Launch all **Unreviewed** and **In review** applications in an [isolated browser](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/common-policies/#1-isolate-unreviewed-or-in-review-applications).
- [Block access](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/common-policies/#2-block-unapproved-applications) to all **Unapproved** applications.
- Limit file upload capabilities for specific application statuses.

To create an HTTP status policy directly from Shadow IT Discovery:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Insights**.
2. Select **Dashboards** > **Shadow IT: SaaS analytics**.
3. Select **Set application statuses**.
4. Select **Manage HTTP status policies**, then choose an application status and select **Create policy**.

## Available insights

The Shadow IT SaaS analytics dashboard includes several insights to help you monitor and manage SaaS application usage.

- **Number of applications by status**: A breakdown of how many applications have been categorized into each [approval status](#1-review-applications). The list of applications is available in the [App Library](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/app-library/).
- **Data uploaded per application status**: A time-series graph showing the amount of data (in gigabytes) uploaded to an application in the given status.
- **Data downloaded per application status**: A time-series graph showing the amount of data (in gigabytes) downloaded from an application in the given status.
- **User count per application status**: A time-series graph showing the number of users who have interacted with at least one application in a given status. For example, a user can use an **Approved** application shortly followed by an **In review** application, contributing to counts for both of those statuses.
- **Top-N metrics**: A collection of metrics providing insights into top applications, users, devices, and countries.
