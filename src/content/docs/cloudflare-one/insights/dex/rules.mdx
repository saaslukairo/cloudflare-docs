DEX rules allow you to create and manage testing policies for targeted user groups within your [fleet](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/). After creating a rule, you can use it to define the scope of a [test](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/) to specific groups such as departments (like finance or sales), devices, and/or users. You can apply and reuse rules on your desired tests.

DEX rules are ideal for admins who want to define the scope of a test to a specific group within their fleet to allow for more precise problem detection and resolution.

## Create a rule

To create a rule:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Rules**.
2. Select **Add a rule**.
3. Give your rule a name and build your desired expressions.
4. Select **Create rule** to finalize your rule.

### Selectors

Selectors are required categories in a DEX rule expression that define a group within a fleet. The selector(s) you have defined in a rule will determine which group a test will impact.

Review the available selectors and their scope in the following list.

| Selector                     | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User email**               | For specifying [user emails](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/identity-selectors/#user-email).                                    |
| **User group emails**        | For specifying [group emails](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/identity-selectors/#user-group-email).                             |
| **User group IDs**           | For specifying [group IDs](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/identity-selectors/#user-group-ids).                                  |
| **User group names**         | For specifying a [group name](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/identity-selectors/#user-group-names).                             |
| **Operating systems**        | For specifying operating systems.                                                                                                 |
| **Operating system version** | For specifying an operating system version (use Operator `in`) or versions (use Operator `is`).                                   |
| **Managed network**          | For specifying users accessing the network from the office (managed network) compared to those accessing remotely.                |
| **SAML attributes**          | For specifying a value from the [SAML Attribute Assertion](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/identity-selectors/#saml-attributes). |
| **Colos**                    | For specifying a Cloudflare data center location users are connected to.                                                          |

## Add a rule to a test

After you have created a rule, you can add it to a test. If you do not add a rule to a test, the test will run on your entire device fleet.

To add a rule to a test:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Tests**.
2. Choose an existing test and select **Edit**, or select **Add a test** to make a new test.
3. Under **Select DEX rules**, select the rule you would like to apply.
4. Select **Save test** for an existing rule or **Add rule** for the new test.
