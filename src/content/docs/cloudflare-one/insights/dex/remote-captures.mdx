Remote captures allow administrators to collect packet captures (PCAPs) and WARP diagnostic logs directly from end user devices. This data can be used to troubleshoot network problems, investigate security incidents, and identify performance bottlenecks.

## Start a remote capture

<Render file="dex/pcaps-run" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Check remote capture status

<Render file="dex/pcaps-check" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Download remote captures

<Render file="dex/pcaps-download" product="cloudflare-one" />

### Device PCAP contents

The downloaded PCAP folder contains three files:

- `capture-default.pcap`: Packet captures for the primary network interface.
- `capture-tunnel.pcap`: Packet captures for traffic inside of the WARP tunnel.
- `results.json`: Reports successful and failed packet captures.

You can analyze `.pcap` files using Wireshark or another third-party packet capture tool.

### WARP Diag contents

Refer to [WARP diagnostic logs](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/troubleshooting/warp-logs/#warp-diag-logs) for a description of each file.

## Limitations

- Packet captures are subject to the following limits:

  | Limit Type  | Maximum Value |
  | ----------- | ------------- |
  | Time limit  | 600 seconds   |
  | File size   | 50 MB         |
  | Packet size | 1500 bytes    |

- WARP diagnostic logs have no file size limit, but files larger than 100 MB cannot be uploaded to Cloudflare and must be shared directly with the admin.

- Windows devices do not support concurrent remote captures. If you start a remote capture while another is in progress, the second capture will fail immediately.

- PCAPs will fail on Windows if you have another third-party packet capture tool (such as, Packet Monitor `pktmon`) running.

- On Windows, packet captures may fail on devices configured with a non-English language due to limitations with the underlying `PktMon` tool.
