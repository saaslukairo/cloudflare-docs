When creating a Cloudflare Zero Trust account, you will be given the Super Administrator role. As a Super Administrator, you can invite members to join your Zero Trust account and assign them different roles. There is no limit to the number of members which can be added to a given account. Any members with the proper permissions will be able to make configuration changes while actively logged into Zero Trust (unless [read-only mode](/cloudflare-one/api-terraform/#set-dashboard-to-read-only) is enabled).

To check the list of members in your account, or to manage roles and permissions, refer to our [Account setup](/fundamentals/manage-members/) documentation.

## Zero Trust roles

Only Super Administrators will be able to assign or remove the following roles from users in their account. Scroll to the right to see a full list of permissions for each role.

[^1]: The **Cloudflare Zero Trust** role grants administrator access to all Zero Trust products including Access, Gateway, WARP, Tunnel, Browser Isolation, CASB, DLP, DEX, and Email security.

[^2]: Users with the **Cloudflare Zero Trust DNS Locations Write** role can view all DNS locations for an organization but can only create and edit [secure DNS locations](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/agentless/dns/locations/#secure-dns-locations).

### Cloudflare Zero Trust PII

By default, only Super Administrators can view end users' PII in the Gateway activity logs, such as Device IDs, Source IPs, or user emails. No other roles will have the ability to read PII unless Super Administrators explicitly assign the **Cloudflare Zero Trust PII** role to them.

The Cloudflare Zero Trust PII role should be considered an add-on role, to be combined with any role from the table above. For example, Super Administrators may decide to assign the Cloudflare Gateway role to a user, and add the Cloudflare Zero Trust PII role to allow that user to access PII in the Gateway logs.

:::note
The Cloudflare Zero Trust PII role does not apply to Access audit logs. PII is always visible in Access logs.
