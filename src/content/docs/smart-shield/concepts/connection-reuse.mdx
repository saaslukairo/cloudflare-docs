Smart Shield leverages Cloudflare's optimized infrastructure to package multiple requests from an [upper-tier](/smart-shield/configuration/smart-tiered-cache/) into a single connection to your origin. This means overall connections to your origin are lowered by 30% on average. Refer to the [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-observatory-and-smart-shield/#protecting-and-accelerating-origins-with-smart-connection-reuse) for details.
