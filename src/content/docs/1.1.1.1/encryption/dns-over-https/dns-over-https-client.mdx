description: Learn how to connect to Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) clients.

Several DoH clients are available for connecting to 1.1.1.1.

## Cloudflare WARP client

Refer to [WARP client](/warp-client/) for guidance on WARP modes and get-started information for different [operating systems](/warp-client/get-started/).

## DNSCrypt-Proxy

The [DNSCrypt-Proxy](https://dnscrypt.info) 2.0+ supports DoH out of the box. It supports both 1.1.1.1 and other services. It also includes more advanced features, such as load balancing and local filtering.

1. [Install DNSCrypt-Proxy](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation).

2. Verify that `dnscrypt-proxy` is installed and the version is 2.0 or later:

   ```sh
   dnscrypt-proxy -version
   ```

   ```sh output
   2.0.8
   ```

3. Set up the configuration file using the [official instructions](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation#setting-up-dnscrypt-proxy), and add `cloudflare` and `cloudflare-ipv6` to the server list in `dnscrypt-proxy.toml`:

   ```toml
   server_names = ['cloudflare', 'cloudflare-ipv6']
   ```

4. Make sure that nothing else is running on `localhost:53`, and check that everything works as expected:

   ```sh
   dnscrypt-proxy -resolve cloudflare-dns.com
   ```

   ```sh output
   Resolving [cloudflare-dns.com]

   Domain exists:  yes, 3 name servers found
   Canonical name: cloudflare-dns.com.
   IP addresses:   2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:6f19, 2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:7019, 104.16.111.25, 104.16.112.25
   TXT records:    -
   Resolver IP:    172.68.140.217
   ```

5. Register it as a system service according to the [DNSCrypt-Proxy installation instructions](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation).
