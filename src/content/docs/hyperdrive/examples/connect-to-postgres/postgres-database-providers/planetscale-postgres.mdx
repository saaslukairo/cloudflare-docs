This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) PostgreSQL database.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing PlanetScale PostgreSQL database by creating a new role (optional) and retrieving a connection string to your database.

### PlanetScale Dashboard

1. Go to the [**PlanetScale dashboard**](https://app.planetscale.com/) and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. Click **Connect**.
3. Create a new role for your Hyperdrive configuration (recommended):
   1. Ensure the minimum required permissions for Hyperdrive to read and write data to your tables:
      - **pg_read_all_data**: Read data from all tables, views, and sequences
      - **pg_write_all_data**: Write data to all tables, views, and sequences
   2. Click **Create role**.
4. Note the user, the password, the database host, and the database name (or `postgres` as the default database). You will need these to create a database configuration in Hyperdrive.

With the host, database name, username and password, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

:::note

When connecting to a PlanetScale PostgreSQL database with Hyperdrive, you should use a driver like [node-postgres (pg)](/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/) or [Postgres.js](/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/) to connect directly to the underlying database instead of the [PlanetScale serverless driver](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver). Hyperdrive is optimized for database access for Workers and will perform global connection pooling and fast query routing by connecting directly to your database.
