This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Fly Postgres database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Fly database by:

1. Allocating a public IP address to your Fly database instance
2. Configuring an external service
3. Deploying the configuration
4. Obtain the connection string, which is used to connect the database to Hyperdrive.

<Steps>
1. Run the following command to [allocate a public IP address](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#allocate-an-ip-address).

    ```txt
    fly ips allocate-v6 --app <pg-app-name>
    ```

    :::note
    Cloudflare recommends using IPv6, but some Internet service providers may not support IPv6. In this case, [you can allocate an IPv4 address](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-with-flyctl/).
    :::

2.  [Configure an external service](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#configure-an-external-service) by modifying the contents of your `fly.toml` file. Run the following command to download the `fly.toml` file.

    ```txt
    fly config save --app <pg-app-name>
    ```

    Then, replace the `services` and `services.ports` section of the file with the following `toml` snippet:

    ```toml
    [[services]]
    	internal_port = 5432 # Postgres instance
    	protocol = "tcp"

    [[services.ports]]
    	handlers = ["pg_tls"]
    	port = 5432
    ```

3.  [Deploy the new configuration](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#deploy-with-the-new-configuration).
4.  [Obtain the connection string](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-external/#adapting-the-connection-string), which is in the form of:

        ```txt
        postgres://{username}:{password}@{public-hostname}:{port}/{database}?options
        ```

</Steps>

## 2. Create a database configuration

<Render file="create-hyperdrive-config" product="hyperdrive" />
<Render file="create-hyperdrive-config-next-steps" product="hyperdrive" />
