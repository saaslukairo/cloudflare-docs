This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a Digital Ocean database instance.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

### DigitalOcean Dashboard

<Steps>
	1. Go to the DigitalOcean dashboard and select the database you wish to
	connect to. 2. Go to the **Overview** tab. 3. Under the **Connection Details**
	panel, select **Public network**. 4. On the dropdown menu, select **Connection
	string** > **show-password**. 5. Copy the connection string.
</Steps>

With the connection string, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

## 2. Create a database configuration

<Render file="create-hyperdrive-config" product="hyperdrive" />
<Render file="create-hyperdrive-config-next-steps" product="hyperdrive" />

:::note
If you see a DNS-related error, it is possible that the DNS for your vendor's database has not yet been propagated. Try waiting 10 minutes before retrying the operation. Refer to [DigitalOcean support page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/support/why-does-my-domain-fail-to-resolve/) for more information.
