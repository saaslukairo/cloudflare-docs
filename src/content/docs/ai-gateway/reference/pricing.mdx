AI Gateway is available to use on all plans.

AI Gateway's core features available today are offered for free, and all it takes is a Cloudflare account and one line of code to [get started](/ai-gateway/get-started/). Core features include: dashboard analytics, caching, and rate limiting.

We will continue to build and expand AI Gateway. Some new features may be additional core features that will be free while others may be part of a premium plan. We will announce these as they become available.

You can monitor your usage in the AI Gateway dashboard.

## Persistent logs

Persistent logs are available on all plans, with a free allocation for both free and paid plans. Charges for additional logs beyond those limits are based on the number of logs stored per month.

### Free allocation and overage pricing

Allocations are based on the total logs stored across all gateways. For guidance on managing or deleting logs, please see our [documentation](/ai-gateway/observability/logging).
