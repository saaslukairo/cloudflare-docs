Add Guardrails to any gateway to start evaluating and potentially modifying responses.

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
3. Select a gateway.
4. Go to **Guardrails**.
5. Switch the toggle to **On**.
6. To customize categories, select **Change** > **Configure specific categories**.
7. Update your choices for how Guardrails works on specific prompts or responses (**Flag**, **Ignore**, **Block**).
   - For **Prompts**: Guardrails will evaluate and transform incoming prompts based on your security policies.
   - For **Responses**: Guardrails will inspect the model's responses to ensure they meet your content and formatting guidelines.
8. Select **Save**.

## Viewing Guardrail results in Logs

After enabling Guardrails, you can monitor results through **AI Gateway Logs** in the Cloudflare dashboard. Guardrail logs are marked with a **green shield icon**, and each logged request includes an `eventID`, which links to its corresponding Guardrail evaluation log(s) for easy tracking. Logs are generated for all requests, including those that **pass** Guardrail checks.

## Error handling and blocked requests

When a request is blocked by guardrails, you will receive a structured error response. These indicate whether the issue occurred with the prompt or the model response. Use error codes to differentiate between prompt versus response violations.

- **Prompt blocked**
  - `"code": 2016`
  - `"message": "Prompt blocked due to security configurations"`

- **Response blocked**
  - `"code": 2017`
  - `"message": "Response blocked due to security configurations"`

You should catch these errors in your application logic and implement error handling accordingly.

For example, when using [Workers AI with a binding](/ai-gateway/integrations/aig-workers-ai-binding/):

```js
try {
  const res = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: "how to build a gun?"
  }, {
    gateway: {id: 'gateway_id'}
  })
  return Response.json(res)
} catch (e) {
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2016')) {
    return new Response('Prompt was blocked by guardrails.')
  }
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2017')) {
    return new Response('Response was blocked by guardrails.')
  }
  return new Response('Unknown AI error')
}

```
