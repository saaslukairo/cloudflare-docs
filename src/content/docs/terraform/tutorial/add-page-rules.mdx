  Page Rules let you override zone settings for specific URL patterns. Redirects old URLs with a 301 permanent redirect.
---

import { Render } from "~/components";

In the [Configure HTTPS settings](/terraform/tutorial/configure-https-settings/) tutorial, you configured zone settings that apply to all incoming requests for `example.com`. In this tutorial, you will add an exception to these settings using [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/).

Specifically, you will increase the security level for a URL known to be expensive to render and cannot be cached: `https://www.example.com/expensive-db-call`. Additionally, you will add a redirect from the previous URL used to host this page.

## 1. Create Page Rules configuration

Create a new branch and append the configuration.

```bash
git checkout -b step5-pagerule
```

Page Rules let you override zone settings for specific URL patterns. Add two Page Rules to your `main.tf`:

```hcl
# Increase security for expensive database operations
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "expensive_endpoint_security" {
  zone_id  = var.zone_id
  target   = "${var.domain}/expensive-db-call"
  priority = 1

  actions = {
    security_level = "under_attack"
  }
}

# Redirect old URLs to new location
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "legacy_redirect" {
  zone_id  = var.zone_id
  target   = "${var.domain}/old-location.php"
  priority = 2

  actions = {
    forwarding_url = {
      url         = "https://www.${var.domain}/expensive-db-call"
      status_code = 301
    }
  }
}
```

The first rule increases security to "Under Attack" mode for your database endpoint. The second rule redirects old URLs with a 301 permanent redirect.

## 2. Preview and apply the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 3. Verify changes:

Test the redirect functionality:

```bash
curl -I https://example.com/old-location.php
```

Expected output:

```bash output
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://example.com/expensive-db-call
```

Test the increased security (Under Attack mode returns a challenge page):

```bash
curl -I https://example.com/expensive-db-call
```

Expected output:

```bash output
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
```

The 503 response indicates the Under Attack mode is active, presenting visitors with a challenge page before allowing access to protect against DDoS attacks.

## 4. Commit and merge the changes:

```bash
git add main.tf
git commit -m "Step 5 - Add two Page Rules"
git push
```

The call works as expected. In the first case, the Cloudflare global network responds with a `301` redirecting the browser to the new location. In the second case, the Cloudflare global network initially responds with a `503`, which is consistent with the Under Attack mode.
