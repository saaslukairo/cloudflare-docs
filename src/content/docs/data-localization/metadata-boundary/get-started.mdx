You can configure the Metadata Boundary to select the region where your logs and analytics are stored via API or dashboard.

Currently, this can only be applied at the account-level. If you only want the Metadata Boundary to be applied on a portion of zones beneath the same account, you will have to [move the rest of zones to a new account](/fundamentals/manage-domains/move-domain/).

## Configure Customer Metadata Boundary in the dashboard

To configure Customer Metadata Boundary in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/configurations" />

2. In **Customer Metadata Boundary**, select the region you want to use. You have the option to select `EU` or `US`. If you want to select both regions, select `Global` instead.

## Configure Customer Metadata Boundary via API

You can also configure Customer Metadata Boundary via API.

Currently, only SuperAdmins and Admin roles can edit DLS configurations. Use the **Account-level Logs:Read/Write** API permissions for the `/logs/control/cmb` endpoint to read/write Customer Metadata Boundary configurations.

These are some examples of API requests.

<Details header="Get current regions">

Here is an example request using cURL to get current regions (if any):

<APIRequest
  path="/accounts/{account_id}/logs/control/cmb/config"
  method="GET"
/>

</Details>

<Details header="Setting regions">

Here is an example request using cURL to set regions:

<APIRequest
  path="/accounts/{account_id}/logs/control/cmb/config"
  method="POST"
  json={{
    regions: "eu",
    allow_out_of_region_access: false
  }}
/>

This will overwrite any previous regions.
Change will be in effect after several minutes.

</Details>

<Details header="Delete regions">

Here is an example request using cURL to delete regions:

<APIRequest
  path="/accounts/{account_id}/logs/control/cmb/config"
  method="DELETE"
/>

</Details>
