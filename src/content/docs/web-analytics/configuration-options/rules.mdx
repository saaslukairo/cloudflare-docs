2. Find the site you want to configure and select **Manage site**.
3. Select **Advanced options** > **Add rule**.
4. Select the **Action** and fill in the hostname and path(s) you want to add a rule for.
5. If you want to add additional rules, select **Add rule**. Otherwise select **Update** to save the rule.
