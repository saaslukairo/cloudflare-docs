To filter the data shown on Web Analytics:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Web Analytics** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/web-analytics" />

2. Select the website you want to check.
3. Select **Add filter**.
4. In the **New filter** box, choose your criteria from the dropdown. Refer to the [Dimensions](/web-analytics/data-metrics/dimensions/) page for a list of available filters and their descriptions.
5. Select **Apply**.

### Additional tips

- By default, Web Analytics shows data for the previous 24 hours. Adjust the time range using the dropdown menu above the graph.
- Select and drag the cursor on the graph to choose a custom time period.
- Scroll below the graph to view detailed breakdowns, for instance of top visits by country or by device type.
