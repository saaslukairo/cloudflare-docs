R2 exposes analytics that allow you to inspect the requests and storage of the buckets in your account.

The metrics displayed for a bucket in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) are queried from Cloudflare's [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

R2 currently has two datasets:

| <div style="width:100px">Dataset </div> | <div style="width:235px">GraphQL Dataset Name </div> | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operations                              | `r2OperationsAdaptiveGroups`                         | This dataset consists of the operations taken on a bucket within an account. |
| Storage                                 | `r2StorageAdaptiveGroups`                            | This dataset consists of the storage of a bucket within an account.          |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days. These datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID.

:::caution[Querying buckets with jurisdiction restriction]
In you account, you may have two buckets of the same name, one with a specified jurisdiction, and one without.

Therefore, if you want to query metrics about a bucket which has a specified jurisdiction, you must include the [jurisdiction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions) followed by an underscore before the bucket name. For example: `eu_bucket-name`. This ensures you query the correct bucket.
:::

## View via the dashboard

Per-bucket analytics for R2 are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a bucket:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **R2 object storage** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/r2/overview" />
2. Select your bucket.
3. Select the **Metrics** tab.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your R2 buckets via the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same dataset as the Cloudflare dashboard, and supports GraphQL [introspection](/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

## Examples

### Operations

To query the volume of each operation type on a bucket for a given time period you can run a query as such

```graphql graphql-api-explorer
query R2VolumeExample(
	$accountTag: string!
	$startDate: Time
	$endDate: Time
	$bucketName: string
) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			r2OperationsAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					datetime_geq: $startDate
					datetime_leq: $endDate
					bucketName: $bucketName
				}
			) {
				sum {
					requests
				}
				dimensions {
					actionType
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The `bucketName` field can be removed to get an account level overview of operations. The volume of operations can be broken down even further by adding more dimensions to the query.

### Storage

To query the storage of a bucket over a given time period you can run a query as such.

```graphql graphql-api-explorer
query R2StorageExample(
	$accountTag: string!
	$startDate: Time
	$endDate: Time
	$bucketName: string
) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			r2StorageAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					datetime_geq: $startDate
					datetime_leq: $endDate
					bucketName: $bucketName
				}
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				max {
					objectCount
					uploadCount
					payloadSize
					metadataSize
				}
				dimensions {
					datetime
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
