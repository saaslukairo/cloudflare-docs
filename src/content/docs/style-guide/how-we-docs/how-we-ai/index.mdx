This section shares how Cloudflare uses AI to accelerate and augment our content operations. We view AI as a tool that enables us to do our best work, faster. Whether we are designing prompts, researching a new product, or finding ways to turn a manual, week-long process into a job that takes an afternoon to complete, we are continuously looking for ways to iterate and streamline our operations. We know that when we can save time on one time-intensive task, we can spend more time on improving our content experiences for our customers.

As a result, we use and have used AI to:

- Vibecode, test, and deploy a web application for scoring in-product strings, error messages, and API docs.
- Perform competitive analyses and audits on documentation.
- Streamline documenting REST API examples.
- Design prompts based on our content types, templates, and style to enable stakeholders with a doc idea to quickly draft content for us to review and publish.
- Find topics missing descriptions, generate descriptions based on the page’s content, and add them to each page.
- And more…

We hope you learn from the topics below. As always, [submit a pull request](/style-guide/contributions/) if you find something that is inaccurate, missing, or needs more information.
