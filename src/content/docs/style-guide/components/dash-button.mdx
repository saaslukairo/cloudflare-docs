import AvailableDashRoutes from "~/components/AvailableDashRoutes.astro";

This component creates a [LinkButton](/style-guide/components/buttons/) that links to a Cloudflare dashboard deeplink.

While we recommend the use of `DashButton`, you can continue to use deeplinks (as a link, without the component), if necessary.

:::note[Where routes are stored]
The list of available routes are generated by running a script that we manually trigger periodically. The script outputs the available paths in [`src/content/dash-routes/index.json`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/blob/production/src/content/dash-routes/index.json).

The `DashButton` component then uses those routes to automatically generate the list of buttons on this page. The `DashButton` will fail to build if you edit the `url` prop to a route that is not listed in the `index.json` file.

Additionally, each run of the script overwrites the previous `/dash-routes/index.json` file. If you edit the this file manually, it will be overwritten in the next run of the script.

Therefore, only make manual changes to this file if both of the following are true:

- The link is already live in the dashboard.
- The name-change is confirmed, and there's no (or little) chance of rollback.
