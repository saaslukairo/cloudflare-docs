Asides are a built-in component provided by [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/components/asides/). Although there are more options, use only the ones below.

## Note

Use Note for small additions or when you need to provide extra context that is not essential to the main content.

If you do not provide a header, this aside will default to `Note`.

```mdx
:::note[Header]
Hello, world!
:::
```

:::note[Header]
Hello, world!
:::

## Caution

Use Caution to highlight actions that could cause issues for a user.

If you do not provide a header, this aside will default to `Warning`.

```mdx
:::caution[Feature conflict]
If you use feature A and feature B together, your configuration will not work.
:::
```

:::caution[Feature conflict]
If you use feature A and feature B together, your configuration will not work.

## Tip

Use Tip to share best practices or opinionated use cases that do not fit into the main documentation.

If you do not provide a header, this aside will default to `Tip`.

```mdx
:::tip[Best practice]
