<Description>
Secure your network and improve performance at Cloudflare scale.
</Description>

<Plan type="enterprise" />

Magic Transit is a network security and performance solution that offers DDoS protection, traffic acceleration, and more for on-premises, cloud-hosted, and hybrid networks.

- **DDoS mitigation and protection**: Instead of relying on local infrastructure that can be overwhelmed by large DDoS attacks, Magic Transit uses the [global Cloudflare Network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) to ingest and mitigate attacks close to their source.
- **Traffic acceleration**: Magic Transit takes advantage of the Cloudflare global network to reduce latency and ensure that requests always have a data center nearby.
