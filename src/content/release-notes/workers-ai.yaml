    title: Adding gpt-oss models to our catalog
    description: |-
      - Check out the [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/openai-gpt-oss-on-workers-ai) for more details about the new models
      - Take a look at the [`gpt-oss-120b`](/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b) and [`gpt-oss-20b`](/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-20b) model pages for more information about schemas, pricing, and context windows
  - publish_date: "2025-04-09"
    title: Pricing correction for @cf/myshell-ai/melotts
    description: |-
      - We've updated our documentation to reflect the correct pricing for melotts: $0.0002 per audio minute, which is actually cheaper than initially stated. The documented pricing was incorrect, where it said users would be charged based on input tokens.
  - publish_date: "2025-03-17"
    title: Minor updates to the model schema for llama-3.2-1b-instruct, whisper-large-v3-turbo, llama-guard
    description: |-
      - [llama-3.2-1b-instruct](/workers-ai/models/llama-3.2-1b-instruct/) - updated context window to the accurate 60,000
      - [whisper-large-v3-turbo](/workers-ai/models/whisper-large-v3-turbo/) - new hyperparameters available
      - [llama-guard-3-8b](/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/) - the messages array must alternate between `user` and `assistant` to function correctly
  - publish_date: "2025-02-21"
    title: Workers AI bug fixes
    description: |-
      - We fixed a bug where `max_tokens` defaults were not properly being respected - `max_tokens` now correctly defaults to `256` as displayed on the model pages. Users relying on the previous behaviour may observe this as a breaking change. If you want to generate more tokens, please set the `max_tokens` parameter to what you need.
      - We updated model pages to show context windows - which is defined as the tokens used in the prompt + tokens used in the response. If your prompt + response tokens exceed the context window, the request will error. Please set `max_tokens` accordingly depending on your prompt length and the context window length to ensure a successful response.

    description: |-
      We will be deprecating `@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8` on 2024-06-30.

      Replace the model ID in your code with a new model of your choice:
      - [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct`](/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/) is the newest model in the Llama family (and is currently free for a limited time on Workers AI).
      - [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`](/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq/) is the new Llama 3 in a similar precision to your currently selected model. This model is also currently free for a limited time.

      If you do not switch to a different model by June 30th, we will automatically start returning inference from `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`.

        Moving to native AI bindings is highly recommended
