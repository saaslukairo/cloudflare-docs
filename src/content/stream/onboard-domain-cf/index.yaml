title: Onboard your domain to Cloudflare
description: Learn how Cloudflare secures and accelerates your website using its global network and reverse proxy technology. In this video, we explain how connecting your domain to Cloudflare protects your origin server, enhances performance, and keeps your site online—even during attacks. You'll see how DNS, nameservers, and proxy status work together to route and safeguard traffic. Whether you're self-hosting or using serverless platforms like Cloudflare Workers, this guide helps you understand the onboarding process and why Cloudflare is essential for modern web infrastructure.

  00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.760
  Cloudflare operates a global network that 
  makes your online presence faster and protect

  2
  00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.120
  it from cyber attacks.

  3
  00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.840
  When you connect a website or app to 
  Cloudflare,

  4
  00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.040
  we act as both the authoritative DNS provider 
  and a reverse proxy that sits between your

  5
  00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.160
  visitors and your origin servers.

  6
  00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.960
  When a visitor or an attacker tries to reach 
  your website,

  7
  00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.080
  those requests are first routed to the 
  Cloudflare network instead of your origin

  8
  00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.240
  server. Cloudflare processes those requests, 
  mitigating malicious traffic while speeding

  9
  00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.600
  up legitimate traffic.

  10
  00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.000
  Our services are customizable to give you 
  granular control over your traffic.

  11
  00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
  You can write rules to cache, 
  load, balance and redirect requests,

  12
  00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.000
  modify headers, execute code, 
  and more.

  13
  00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.880
  Many of our services are on by default, 
  such as DDoS protection and caching,

  14
  00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.240
  so your traffic will automatically be safer 
  and faster.

  15
  00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.280
  To make this possible, 
  you need to onboard your domain to

  16
  00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.440
  Cloudflare. The most common way to onboard 
  your domain is to update your DNS name

  17
  00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.370
  servers to the Cloudflare name servers we 
  provide you,

  18
  00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.690
  which makes Cloudflare your authoritative DNS 
  provider.

  19
  00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.730
  You do this at the provider you purchase your 
  domain name from,

  20
  00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.570
  such as a registrar. If you need a new 
  domain,

  21
  00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.370
  you can purchase one at cost from the 
  Cloudflare registrar,

  22
  00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.610
  which is automatically configured to use our 
  name servers.

  23
  00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.610
  Let's review the basics of name servers and 
  DNS.

  24
  00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.210
  A name server is a service operated by your 
  authoritative DNS provider that acts as a

  25
  00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.890
  source of truth for your domain's DNS 
  records.

  26
  00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.810
  Dns records map a human readable hostname, 
  such as example.com,

  27
  00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.650
  to machine readable IP addresses or data.

  28
  00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.890
  The IP address listed in a DNS record 
  identifies where your origin server is

  29
  00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.530
  hosted. These DNS records tell your 
  authoritative DNS provider how to respond to

  30
  00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.370
  DNS queries for your domain.

  31
  00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.690
  So altogether, DNS allows internet browsers 
  such as Google Chrome to find the correct

  32
  00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.250
  content. Then the browser can make HTTP 
  requests to load the content for your

  33
  00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.970
  visitors. If you're not using a reverse proxy 
  such as Cloudflare.

  34
  00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.490
  The browser makes HTTP requests directly to 
  the IP address of your origin server.

  35
  00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.650
  This is not secure because your origin is 
  exposed to the internet without protection.

  36
  00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.290
  When Cloudflare is in front of your origin, 
  we act as both your authoritative DNS

  37
  00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.850
  provider and a reverse proxy for your HTTP 
  requests.

  38
  00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.850
  We respond to DNS queries with Cloudflare IP 
  addresses,

  39
  00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.090
  which makes your HTTP traffic go through 
  Cloudflare instead of directly to your

  40
  00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.850
  origin. This process is called reverse 
  Proxying,

  41
  00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.610
  which allows us to hide and therefore protect 
  your origin server.

  42
  00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.330
  Furthermore, we highly recommend blocking 
  traffic that doesn't come through Cloudflare

  43
  00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.210
  by configuring your origins firewall to only 
  allow Cloudflare IP addresses or using

  44
  00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.170
  Cloudflare Tunnel. You can identify which 
  traffic is proxy in the DNS records table in

  45
  00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.530
  the Cloudflare dashboard.

  46
  00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.130
  If the proxy status is set to proxy, 
  requests for those hostname will flow through

  47
  00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.370
  the Cloudflare network.

  48
  00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.450
  This will start happening once you update 
  your nameservers.

  49
  00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.380
  If the status is as DNS only.

  50
  00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.620
  Requests for those hostnames will only use 
  Cloudflare for DNS resolution.

  51
  00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.860
  Let's follow an HTTP request as it gets 
  processed by Cloudflare when someone visits

  52
  00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.940
  or tries to attack your website or app.

  53
  00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.460
  That request will be routed to the Cloudflare 
  data center that's closest to that visitor.

  54
  00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.740
  If a request is from a legitimate user, 
  we check if it's for a resource that's in the

  55
  00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.300
  Cloudflare cache. If we don't have it cached,

  56
  00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.620
  we proxy the request to your origin server.

  57
  00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.940
  We then cache the origins response.

  58
  00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.220
  So the next time Cloudflare sees a request 
  for the same resource,

  59
  00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.860
  we can deliver it straight away.

  60
  00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.620
  We block suspicious requests from reaching 
  your origin,

  61
  00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.300
  only allowing legitimate users and speeding 
  up their experience.

  62
  00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.540
  So you will always have the most up to date 
  security posture,

  63
  00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.500
  including protection from Sierra de 
  vulnerabilities,

  64
  00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.740
  advanced DDoS attacks, 
  and more.

  65
  00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.580
  Cloudflare is an extension of your 
  infrastructure,

  66
  00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.140
  keeping your site safe and highly available.
