  00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.540
  Cloudflare's Connectivity Cloud hosts a
  complete Secure Access Service Edge,

  2
  00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.790
  or SASE platform, which allows organizations
  to create a new corporate network leveraging

  3
  00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.930
  the latest in zero trust security approaches
  and cloud based networking.

  4
  00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.320
  Many companies start by connecting
  applications,

  5
  00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.970
  networks and user devices to Cloudflare to
  use Zero Trust Network Access,

  6
  00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.800
  or ZTNA to authorize users to connect to
  self-hosted applications and private

  7
  00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.560
  networks. But connecting devices and networks
  into Cloudflare can also help secure public

  8
  00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.130
  Internet access and increase visibility and
  control over company data.

  9
  00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.240
  Let's take a look at an example of a company
  that has already connected its corporate HQ

  10
  00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.800
  network, along with a few branch offices and
  many remote user devices.

  11
  00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.780
  You can see that all these methods of on
  ramping traffic to Cloudflare result in user

  12
  00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.940
  traffic flowing through our network.

  13
  00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.740
  Sometimes the traffic is destined for a
  private application or network,

  14
  00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.370
  but a lot of the traffic is just heading for
  the public Internet.

  15
  00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.810
  Cloudflare has the ability to inspect that
  traffic using another part of our SASE

  16
  00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.570
  platform, the Secure Web Gateway.

  17
  00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.420
  It can examine traffic either at the DNS
  request,

  18
  00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.070
  the network level, or we can even inspect the
  contents of a HTTP request.

  19
  00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.020
  Do you want to deny users from accessing
  websites known to be part of a phishing

  20
  00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.770
  campaign or ransomware attack,
  or only allow users coming from IP addresses

  21
  00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.140
  in the US to access your Workday instance?

  22
  00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.970
  Or more seriously, do you want to prevent
  employees from sending sensitive information

  23
  00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.050
  like financial data or source code to AI
  sites like ChatGPT?

  24
  00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.990
  Policies in the Secure Web Gateway allow you
  to achieve this,

  25
  00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.780
  and they can be written using a wide variety
  of attributes.

  26
  00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.800
  We can even isolate a website by running not
  in the user's browser,

  27
  00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.460
  but by rendering it in our headless browser,
  running on our own network.

  28
  00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.740
  And then we send the results down to the user
  device,

  29
  00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.670
  and this protects them from any nasty code
  running in that website.

  30
  00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.970
  Let's take a look at the different ways our
  Secure Web Gateway can help protect your

  31
  00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.350
  organization. The first method to protect any
  user or device is to look at their DNS

  32
  00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.940
  requests. Some of the most common policies
  are simply designed to prevent access to

  33
  00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.680
  known high risk websites.

  34
  00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.910
  To make your life easier,
  Cloudflare manages large lists of sites that

  35
  00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.140
  are known to be dangerous.

  36
  00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.380
  Either they've been found to distribute
  malware or they're part of a phishing

  37
  00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.730
  campaign. All you need to do is include that
  category in the deny policy,

  38
  00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.830
  and users will be blocked from visiting them.

  39
  00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.950
  Cloudflare keeps the sites in each category
  up to date.

  40
  00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.260
  In fact, we block an average of 158 billion
  cyber threats a day.

  41
  00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.710
  So we have an amazing view into what's bad
  out there on the Internet.

  42
  00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.500
  You could never maintain this amount of data
  yourself.

  43
  00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.820
  Policies can be applied at the user level or
  be based on network location.

  44
  00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.870
  You might wish to implement a policy that
  limits certain websites depending on the

  45
  00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.850
  country the network request is coming from.

  46
  00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.580
  You can even subscribe to government cyber
  defense lists of known malicious websites.

  47
  00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.250
  You can also use a DNS policy to simplify
  some of your IT infrastructure.

  48
  00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.320
  A policy can override the IP address returned
  from a DNS request and point to a service

  49
  00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.450
  that might be local. For example,
  you might configure all employee laptops to

  50
  00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.300
  use a single hostname for connecting to the
  office printer.

  51
  00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.150
  Let's say it's printer dot company dot local.

  52
  00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.720
  Then, if a user is attempting to print in the
  Seattle office,

  53
  00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
  Cloudflare will replace the IP address for
  that host with the local office printer.

  54
  00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.100
  But if the same user then travels to the
  London office,

  55
  00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.258
  the same laptop makes the same request to
  print and Cloudflare replaces the IP address

  56
  00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:37.410
  now for the London printer.

  57
  00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.800
  The second method of protection is by using
  network policies.

  58
  00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.890
  So for all your networks connected Cloudflare
  SASE platform,

  59
  00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.280
  it's possible to write simple
  firewall-like-rules.

  60
  00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.200
  These are often used to allow access to
  specific services on private IP addresses.

  61
  00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.160
  Say for example, you have a lot of windows
  servers running in your corporate network and

  62
  00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.760
  you want to ensure only IT admins are allowed
  to connect to them over RDP.

  63
  00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.160
  How? Well, when users access Cloudflare using
  our device agent,

  64
  00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.330
  network access policies can use identity
  information such as the method of

  65
  00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.990
  authentication, what groups the user is in as
  part of the policy.

  66
  00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.350
  Device security posture can also be taken
  from that device agent,

  67
  00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.480
  making sure that IT admins access Windows
  servers only using secured company managed

  68
  00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.660
  devices. The third and the one with the most
  control is HTTP policies,

  69
  00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.260
  since it allows you to inspect the actual
  HTTP traffic.

  70
  00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.500
  For devices where a Cloudflare certificate
  has been deployed,

  71
  00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.070
  the TLS and SSL connection terminates at
  Cloudflare,

  72
  00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.520
  where you can inspect the traffic and apply
  your policies.

  73
  00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.900
  You can build policies that limit the
  uploading or downloading of files based on

  74
  00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.220
  their file type, or prevent HTTP POST or PUT
  to prevent the certain upload of content to

  75
  00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.890
  any websites. We also have a sandboxing
  feature where we can use AV scanning to

  76
  00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.060
  examine certain files being downloaded and
  quarantine them if they contain malicious

  77
  00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.880
  content. But the true power of inspecting
  HTTP traffic is when it's combined with our

  78
  00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.410
  DLP policies. Here, we can match any part of
  the HTTP request,

  79
  00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.610
  either the body of the request or if a file
  contains specific content,

  80
  00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.260
  and then protect that data from leaving your
  organization or being downloaded to insecure

  81
  00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.250
  devices. We have built-in DLP profiles for
  matching common data,

  82
  00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.480
  such as health or financial information,
  source code or privately identifiable

  83
  00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.960
  information such as social security or tax
  identifiers.

  84
  00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.390
  You can also create your own DLP profiles by
  either defining patterns to match sensitive

  85
  00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.140
  data, or just by uploading a list of known
  customer accounts.

  86
  00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.700
  Now, when users attempt to download or upload
  any content that matches these profiles,

  87
  00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.530
  you have the ability to block it.

  88
  00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.460
  Sometimes the risk for a website isn't well
  known.

  89
  00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.150
  For example, you might deem social media
  websites to be a little risky,

  90
  00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.030
  but your marketing department still requires
  access.

  91
  00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.900
  Newly registered domains might sometimes be
  part of a phishing campaign,

  92
  00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.300
  or they might just be a legitimate new
  website.

  93
  00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.990
  In these examples, Cloudflare has a really
  cool capability.

  94
  00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.360
  You can write a policy that when a user makes
  a request for a website you think is a little

  95
  00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.960
  risky, instead of their machine receiving all
  the content directly,

  96
  00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.250
  we spin up a headless browser on our network
  and render the content first.

  97
  00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.090
  Here we isolate any potential bad behavior in
  a secure,

  98
  00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.680
  isolated environment. We then send the
  results of the render page down to the user's

  99
  00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.820
  device, and you can optionally turn on and
  off certain capabilities,

  100
  00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.660
  such as the ability to enter text into the
  web page or download files.

  101
  00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.600
  We call this Remote Browser Isolation.

  102
  00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.580
  You can also use this service to limit access
  to SaaS application data for a certain set of

  103
  00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.510
  users. You might, for example,
  want to allow contractors or partners to have

  104
  00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.410
  access to your Salesforce instance,
  and you can use our Browser Isolation to

  105
  00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.830
  prevent copy and paste,
  printing or downloading of Salesforce data.

  106
  00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.330
  So in summary, Cloudflare has a powerful
  range of capabilities to protect users from

  107
  00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.980
  the threat of bad actors on the Internet,
  while also identifying company data and

  108
  00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.720
  protecting its use. You can ensure safe
  browsing by blocking known malicious

  109
  00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.190
  websites, detect when company data is being
  uploaded to unapproved cloud storage,

  110
  00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.350
  or downloaded to insecure devices.

  111
  00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.030
  You can even isolate the entire website so
  that users are protected from any dangerous

  112
  00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.400
  activity. Well, thanks for watching!
