  1
  00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.780
  In the last video, we discussed that if your 
  origin is outside of mainland China and has

  2
  00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.630
  dynamic content that cannot be cashed within 
  China,

  3
  00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.930
  your users may still encounter increased 
  latency,

  4
  00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.240
  leading to poor user experience.

  5
  00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.430
  In this video, we'll go over three main use 
  cases that we can help address dynamic

  6
  00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.500
  content outside of mainland China.

  7
  00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.430
  Access to global services and private network 
  connectivity.

  8
  00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.450
  So depending on your use case, 
  you can choose what best suits your needs.

  9
  00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.340
  Hello, I'm Jez from Cloudflare here to teach 
  you about our Cloudflare solutions for

  10
  00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.530
  mainland China. If your origin is outside of 
  mainland China and has dynamic content that

  11
  00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.550
  cannot be cached within China, 
  CN Global Acceleration,

  12
  00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.080
  formerly known as China Express, 
  can help you with this by leveraging

  13
  00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.060
  dedicated private tunnels established through 
  our trusted local partners including JD

  14
  00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.430
  cloud, CME and CBC tech, 
  we ensure seamless and efficient content

  15
  00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.770
  delivery. Here's how it works.

  16
  00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.210
  Traffic received from our China Network data 
  centers is routed to our premium data

  17
  00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.420
  centers, which have global acceleration 
  privileges that are designed to handle

  18
  00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.190
  dynamic traffic with ease.

  19
  00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
  This includes typical use cases like web API 
  calls,

  20
  00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.400
  as well as more complex scenarios such as 
  dynamic traffic management or multi origin

  21
  00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.650
  configurations. For example, 
  customers using Cloudflare SaaS features like

  22
  00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.050
  R2 for asset storage can integrate these 
  capabilities into our solutions seamlessly.

  23
  00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.880
  Once processed, the traffic is transferred 
  through a partner's dedicated private tunnel

  24
  00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.710
  to the global public internet, 
  ensuring high performance and reliability.

  25
  00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.690
  Besides accelerating dynamic content, 
  you can also reliably access Cloudflare One

  26
  00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.230
  services like Warp, Magic WAN, 
  and travel SIM cards.

  27
  00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.700
  With Warp Global acceleration, 
  Warp client can be extended to China for your

  28
  00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.770
  users under Pre-signed agreements to access 
  the same Zero Trust Network access services,

  29
  00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.930
  just as the rest of your global users, 
  while experiencing stable connectivity

  30
  00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.040
  anywhere within China, 
  no matter if you're at home or a coffee shop.

  31
  00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.730
  Once you receive our dedicated China IPS 
  through Cloudflare and have Warp setup up,

  32
  00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.130
  all you need to do is override the following.

  33
  00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.110
  Warp endpoints for each device.

  34
  00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.130
  Warp endpoint API endpoint and endpoint.

  35
  00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.260
  Verify the colocation center is your desired 
  location under Warp preferences.

  36
  00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.460
  And now you should be able to access global 
  services.

  37
  00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.740
  As for users who are temporarily in China, 
  we can offer travel SIM cards,

  38
  00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.610
  which connect to our Warp client for a 
  seamless and secure mobile acceleration

  39
  00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.170
  abroad. By inserting the SIM card or applying 
  the eSIM to an employee's phone,

  40
  00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.200
  corporate devices, whether it be laptops or 
  tablets,

  41
  00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.400
  can then connect to their organization's Warp 
  client through mobile hotspot.

  42
  00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.810
  Lastly, if your goal is to scale and 
  accelerate private enterprise networks from

  43
  00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.410
  China, Magic WAN Global Acceleration can help 
  you with that.

  44
  00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.170
  You can securely connect to any traffic 
  source,

  45

  such as offices and data centers to 
  Cloudflare network,

  46
  00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.850
  while configuring routing policies tailored 
  to your corporate networking needs from

  47
  00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.250
  China. To extend Magic WAN into China, 
  we provide a customer premises equipment or a

  48
  00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.900
  CPE device which will be shipped to your 
  China based location once the CPE is

  49
  00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.470
  connected to the internet in your physical 
  location.

  50
  00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.910
  Traffic from users who are using the same 
  internet in that location will be routed

  51
  00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.710
  through our dedicated private tunnel to any 
  resource or service to make the process

  52
  00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.830
  effortless. Our team will help you in 
  configuring the CPE.

  53

  your specific needs and can be selected a la

  delivery,

  55
  00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.380
