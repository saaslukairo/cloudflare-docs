  1
  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
  Cloudflare Application Security dashboard for 
  individual domains allows you to manage

  2
  00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.800
  application security features that protect 
  the domain from various web attacks and

  3
  00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.000
  threats. I'll walk you through the interface,

  4
  00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.360
  show you what goes under them and how to use 
  each page to monitor,

  5
  00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.200
  investigate, and manage your security 
  protections.

  6
  00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.800
  First, select the domain you would like to 
  manage your application security on.

  7
  00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.880
  Once you have selected a domain, 
  open up the Application Security dashboard by

  8
  00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.240
  clicking security on the navigation bar here.

  9
  00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.800
  Now on the overview page.

  10
  00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.600
  The Security Overview page gives you a high 
  level summary of your security posture for

  11
  00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.760
  this domain. You'll find alerts for 
  Misconfigurations detected threats and

  12
  00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.200
  suggested actions on how to improve your 
  security posture.

  13
  00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.640
  This is a good place to start and review what 
  needs attention across your environment.

  14
  00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.200
  Under analytics, you can analyze security 
  data across two different views traffic and

  15
  00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.360
  events. Use this page to understand what kind 
  of traffic your domain is receiving and how

  16
  00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.580
  Cloudflare is securing your domain based on 
  the detection tools that are enabled.

  17
  00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.100
  This page also serves as a starting point to 
  identify how you may want to configure your

  18
  00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.300
  application security settings based on the 
  patterns of traffic you're receiving.

  19
  00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.300
  The traffic tab shows data on incoming HTTP 
  requests to your domain,

  20
  00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.220
  including ones that have not been affected by 
  any security tools.

  21
  00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.480
  The events tab shows data on security actions 
  that have been performed by Cloudflare

  22
  00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.700
  Security tools on incoming requests.

  23
  00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.180
  Under web assets, you can manage and monitor 
  the security of various types of web related

  24
  00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.860
  assets. For example, use the endpoints tab to 
  get recommendations and insights about your

  25
  00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.540
  endpoint usage. Use the Schema Validation tab 
  to protect your origin from invalid API

  26
  00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.260
  requests and malicious payloads.

  27
  00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.100
  Schema validation works by validating 
  requests against your own API schema.

  28
  00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.540
  The Client Side Resources tab is used to 
  monitor resources such as scripts,

  29
  00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.380
  connections, and cookies that are running on 
  your visitor's web browsers for your domain.

  30
  00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.090
  If you notice unexpected scripts or 
  connections on the dashboard.

  31
  00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.730
  Check them here for signs of malicious 
  activity.

  32
  00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.610
  Security rules is where you manage and define 
  what security actions are.

  33
  00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.450
  Perform on incoming requests.

  34
  00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.290
  Under the Security Rules tab.

  35
  00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.770
  You can manage and create different types of 
  rules to secure your domain.

  36
  00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.650
  You can create your own custom security rules 
  from scratch or use predefined templates to

  37
  00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.930
  help you get started. Under the DDoS 
  protection tab,

  38
  00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.890
  you'll find a DDoS rulesets that mitigate 
  DDoS attacks on your domain.

  39
  00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.050
  The DDoS Attack Protection rule sets are 
  automatically managed and updated by

  40
  00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.650
  Cloudflare, so you only need to use this tab 
  if you want to create an override rule that

  41
  00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.410
  changes how Cloudflare DDoS protection 
  functions.

  42
  00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.770
  In settings, you can configure Cloudflare 
  detection tools and your domain security

  43
  00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.090
  posture. Security settings and detection 
  tools are categorized by the type of threat

  44
  00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.690
  they detect and mitigate.

  45
  00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.570
  Use the filters on this page to find 
  detection tools and settings that are

  46
  00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.490
  relevant to your security needs.
