  00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.210
  Do you have users in mainland China who are 
  experiencing high latency accessing your

  2
  00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.860
  services? Cloudflare China network solution 
  can help you solve this easily.

  3
  00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.530
  Hello, I'm Jess from Cloudflare here to teach 
  you about our China network products.

  4
  00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.780
  Sometimes when the internet users in mainland 
  China visit your website on Cloudflare global

  5
  00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.620
  network. They are connected to data centers 
  outside of mainland China,

  6
  00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.210
  and these longer distances will lead to high 
  latency and low availability,

  7
  00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.240
  creating a slow and poor user experience.

  8
  00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.160
  We can speed up these web services easily 
  with Cloudflare China network solution,

  9
  00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.530
  with availability improving from 25% to 100% 
  and response time speeding up from 300

  10
  00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040
  milliseconds to just 50 milliseconds.

  11
  00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.160
  How first Cloudflare China network provides 
  caching in mainland China through our partner

  12
  00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.640
  JD cloud, with data centers in 34 cities.

  13
  00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.530
  This means for your users in mainland China, 
  their requests will go to the nearest data

  14
  00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.570
  center inside of mainland China instead of 
  any external Cloudflare data center.

  15
  00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.870
  Shorter distance means faster content 
  delivery.

  16
  00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.980
  These data centers are fully integrated with 
  Cloudflare global network.

  17
  00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.050
  You'll have access to the same configuration 
  tools for cache WAF origin rules and other

  18
  00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.450
  settings, all within a single dashboard.

  19
  00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.330
  The same goes for name servers in Mainland 
  China.

  20
  00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.840
  If the majority of your users are located 
  within Mainland China,

  21
  00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.910
  we offer the option of an Inchina name server 
  that will help speed up DNS resolution.

  22
  00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.070
  Second, the China network is designed to 
  follow mainland China's ICP regulations.

  23
  00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.020
  This means we can guarantee your web service 
  will always remain accessible to users in

  24
  00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.240
  mainland China, without interruptions from 
  local internet service providers or ISPs.

  25
  00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.500
  If you're not sure how ICP works, 
  our China based partners can help you with

  26
  00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.840
  the ICP filing and maintenance.

  27
  00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.210
  Third, for dynamic content that cannot be 
  cached in the data centers within mainland

  28
  00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.300
  China, such as API calls or web apps, 
  users may still experience increased latency

  29
  00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.540
  if your origin is located outside of mainland 
  China.

  30
  00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.590
  So for these cases, we offer the option of 
  China Express,

  31
  00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.870
  which will accelerate both DNS resolution and 
  traffic for origin content.

  32
  00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.840
  Watch our video on China Express to learn 
  more.

  33
  00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.490
  Thus, the China network solutions sound like 
  something that will help you reach out to our

  34
  00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.870
  sales team to learn more.
