  00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.600
  An API token allows secure, 
  fine grained access to specific resources

  2
  00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.080
  without exposing your full account 
  credentials.

  3
  00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.080
  They have a limited lifespan and expire 
  automatically.

  4
  00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.760
  This reduces risk if they are compromised.

  5
  00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.280
  For example, if you want to grant someone 
  access to specific apps or data.

  6
  00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.440
  You can create an API token for them.

  7
  00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.600
  There are two types of tokens user token and 
  account token.

  8
  00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.080
  User tokens are directly tied to an 
  individual and their account.

  9
  00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.240
  While account tokens are typically tied to 
  services which can help prevent an

  10
  00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.640
  interruption in service.

  11
  00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.840
  If an employee leaves their organization.

  12
  00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.080
  In this video, we'll walk through how to 
  create an API token in the Cloudflare

  13
  00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.080
  dashboard. Before you begin, 
  make sure you know your account and zone IDs.

  14
  00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.400
  So let's do that. First, 
  the account ID identifies your Cloudflare

  15
  00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.840
  account, while the zone ID identifies a 
  specific domain you've added to Cloudflare.

  16
  00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.080
  From the accounts page, 
  locate your account at the end of the account

  17
  00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.240
  row, open the menu and select Copy Account 
  ID.

  18
  00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.200
  If you only have one account, 
  it looks a little bit different.

  19
  00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.860
  Login and go to the account home page next to 
  your account name,

  20
  00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.220
  select the menu button from the drop down.

  21
  00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.340
  Choose Copy Account ID to find your zone ID, 
  log in and go to the accounts page.

  22
  00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.180
  Select your account, then go to the overview 
  page for your domain.

  23
  00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.580
  Scroll to the API section near the bottom.

  24
  00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.460
  Here you'll see the zone ID and an option to 
  click to copy.

  25
  00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.500
  This section also lists your account ID for 
  convenience.

  26
  00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.620
  Now we can create an API token to create a 
  token.

  27
  00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.420
  Start from the Cloudflare dashboard.

  28
  00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.220
  For a user token, go to profile API tokens.

  29
  00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.580
  For an account token, 
  go to Manage Account account API tokens.

  30
  00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.620
  You will only see this option if you are a 
  Superadmin.

  31
  00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.780
  Select Create token. You can choose from 
  predefined templates or build a custom token.

  32
  00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.660
  For example, let's use the Edit Zone DNS 
  template.

  33
  00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.260
  Give your token a descriptive name such as 
  DNS updates for example.com.

  34
  00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.500
  The template will fulfill permissions, 
  but you can adjust them as needed.

  35
  00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.620
  Next assign permissions.

  36
  00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.190
  Permissions are organized by account, 
  user or zone and usually offer either read

  37
  00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.790
  access or edit access.

  38
  00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.590
  Edit allows full control, 
  create, read, update,

  39
  00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.030
  delete, and list, while read provides viewing 
  rights only.

  40
  00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.510
  Then select the resources the token applies 
  to.

  41
  00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.510
  For instance, granting zone DNS read access 
  for example.com will let the token view DNS

  42
  00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.070
  records for that zone only.

  43
  00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.070
  If the token is used on a different zone, 
  it will return an error.

  44
  00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.550
  Optionally, you can add restrictions such as 
  filtering by client IP or setting a time to

  45
  00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.110
  live value for the token.

  46
  00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.190
  Click continue to summary to review your 
  selections.

  47
  00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.310
  If everything looks correct, 
  choose Create Token.

  48
  00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.150
  The dashboard will now display your new token 
  secret.

  49
  00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.910
  Copy it immediately to a secure location.

  50
  00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.990
  The secret is shown only once.

  51
  00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.230
  Anyone with a token can perform the actions 
  you've authorized,

  52
  00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.710
  so treat it like a password.

  53
  00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.550
  With that, you've successfully created an API 
  token and can begin using it with a

  54
  00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.070
  Cloudflare API. For more information,
