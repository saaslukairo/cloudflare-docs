  1
  00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.680
  Cloudflare Application Security Dashboard 
  allows you to manage application security

  2
  00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.800
  features that protect your domains and 
  applications from various web attacks and

  3
  00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.440
  threats. In this video, 
  you'll learn how to get immediate protection

  4
  00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.400
  against the most common attacks.

  5
  00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.080
  Use analytics to monitor and investigate 
  traffic patterns and events.

  6
  00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.200
  Handle false positives.

  7
  00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.960
  Create custom rules with filters.

  8
  00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.000
  Depending on your plan, 
  some functionalities may or may not be

  9
  00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.440
  available to you. For more information, 
  visit our developer documentation.

  10
  00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.080
  Before you can start reviewing analytics or 
  fine tuning rules,

  11
  00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.240
  you need to set up and enable rules that will 
  inspect and mitigate incoming threats.

  12
  00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.720
  Let's start by setting up Cloudflare's 
  managed rule set.

  13
  00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.840
  This rule set contains multiple rules 
  designed to detect known vulnerabilities and

  14
  00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.200
  common attack vectors.

  15
  00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.400
  It's updated weekly and also includes 
  emergency patches for zero day threats.

  16
  00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.480
  If you're on a free plan, 
  the free managed rule set is already deployed

  17
  00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.220
  by default, so you don't have to do anything 
  for this step.

  18
  00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.580
  First, log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, 
  select your account and domain and go to

  19
  00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.900
  Security Settings. Second, 
  in the Web Application Exploits category,

  20
  00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620
  locate the Cloudflare managed rule set and 
  turn it on.

  21
  00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.780
  By enabling this rule set, 
  you immediately get broad protection with low

  22
  00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.940
  false positives. Once you've enabled this 
  rule set,

  23
  00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.940
  you can go to the analytics page to start 
  understanding how your rules are working.

  24
  00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.100
  Keep in mind the system needs time to collect 
  data,

  25
  00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.220
  so if you just enable the rule sets, 
  allow some time for incoming traffic to be

  26
  00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.540
  analyzed by Cloudflare.

  27
  00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.220
  Let's check out analytics page.

  28
  00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.460
  There are two different views in analytics.

  29
  00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.660
  The traffic tab shows all incoming HTTP 
  requests to your domain,

  30
  00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.100
  including ones that aren't mitigated by any 
  security rules.

  31
  00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.940
  The events tab only shows requests that 
  triggered a Cloudflare Security action,

  32
  00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.220
  such as block, challenge, 
  or lock.

  33
  00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.900
  Let's start with the traffic tab.

  34
  00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.840
  Here you can identify patterns of traffic 
  through filters like request properties.

  35
  00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.600
  Path source, IP action taken, 
  or rule ID.

  36
  00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.600
  Let's take a look at an example.

  37
  00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.200
  Say that you only want to see only post 
  requests for the login path that contain

  38
  00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.240
  leaked credentials. First click Add filter 
  and enter path equals login.

  39
  00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.200
  Click apply. Then add the following 
  additional filters HTTP method equals post

  40
  00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.560
  leaked credentials. Scan results equals 
  username and password leaked.

  41
  00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.000
  Hover on served by origin, 
  then click filter.

  42
  00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.680
  Now that you're filtering by requests that 
  have actually reached origin with leaked

  43
  00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.040
  credentials, you notice that these requests 
  all come from the same IP address.

  44
  00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.600
  The IP address is displayed in the source IP 
  column in sample logs.

  45
  00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.240
  Also available in top statistics source IPS.

  46
  00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.080
  Let's add that IP to the filters.

  47
  00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.120
  Source IP equals to the IP we see here.

  48
  00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.540
  Not only can you use filters to analyze 
  specific kinds of requests,

  49
  00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.940
  you can also use filters as a starting point 
  for creating your own security rules.

  50
  00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.020
  Let's create a rule using the filters we just 
  applied.

  51
  00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.420
  This rule will represent a security challenge 
  to post requests that contain leaked

  52
  00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.100
  credentials coming from the IP address we 
  specified.

  53
  00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.660
  Click Create Custom Security Rule.

  54
  00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.740
  A preview side panel will appear.

  55
  00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.060
  This preview shows you the beginning of the 
  rule you're building.

  56
  00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.500
  We still need to decide what action happens 
  when requests match this rule.

  57
  00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.780
  So let's select Configure Rule action.

  58
  00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.780
  Now you've been brought to the Rule Builder 
  page under the Security Rule section.

  59
  00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.020
  First let's give a rule a name.

  60
  00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.780
  Next you'll see that the rule expression 
  contains the filters you just applied in the

  61
  00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.620
  analytics page. The rule expression specifies 
  the conditions that must be met for the rule

  62
  00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.580
  to run. You can build a rule expression by 
  either using the expression builder or by

  63
  00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.380
  manually writing the rule expression.

  64
  00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.270
  Now let's select the action we want this rule 
  to perform on matching requests.

  65
  00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.350
  Each of the challenge actions use 
  Cloudflare's Challenge platform to verify

  66
  00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.710
  whether a visitor to a domain is a real 
  human,

  67
  00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.070
  and not a bot or automated script.

  68
  00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.670
  An interactive challenge presents visitors 
  with a challenge they need to solve for the

  69
  00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.110
  request to be successful.

  70
  00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.950
  A JavaScript challenge asks the visitor's web 
  browser to solve a JavaScript based challenge

  71
  00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.270
  in the background. Unlike interactive 
  challenges,

  72
  00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.630
  this type of challenge does not require 
  interactions from a visitor.

  73
  00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.870
  A managed challenge allows Cloudflare to 
  dynamically choose the appropriate type of

  74
  00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.510
  challenge to present to a visitor, 
  based on the characteristics of their

  75
  00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.830
  requests. Aside from the challenge actions, 
  we can choose block to completely block all

  76
  00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.270
  requests that match this rule or skip to skip 
  other rules from a selection of options.

  77
  00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.390
  Enterprise accounts also have the option to 
  log requests that match a rule.

  78
  00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.390
  These logged requests can then be found in 
  the Security Analytics under the events tab.

  79
  00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.790
  In this example, we're going to choose 
  Managed Challenge as the action to take on

  80
  00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.270
  requests that match this rule.

  81
  00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.930
  Lastly, we can use a Select Order dropdown to 
  select whether to place this rule at the

  82
  00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.250
  beginning or end of the execution order.

  83
  00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.810
  Rules that match a request are executed in 
  the way they're placed in,

  84
  00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.450
  starting from one. If multiple rules match 
  with the request and a preceding rule is a

  85
  00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.850
  terminating action, such as a block, 
  no subsequent rules will be performed.

  86
  00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.130
  If you want to place this rule in a specific 
  place of the execution order,

  87
  00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.570
  we can edit this after we deploy the rule.

  88
  00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.450
  Now that we've finished building our rule, 
  select deploy.

  89
  00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.530
  Now you're at the Security Rules Overview 
  page where you manage and create custom

  90
  00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.650
  security rules. And here's the rule we just 
  created.

  91
  00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.970
  If you ever want to edit a rule you created 
  or move its position in the execution order,

  92
  00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.530
  just press the three dots to the right of the 
  rule to find these actions.

  93
  00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.170
  Occasionally, legitimate requests may also 
  get blocked by rule from a managed rule set

  94
  00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.290
  that's created and maintained by Cloudflare.

  95
  00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.570
  These are known as false positives.

  96
  00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.250
  Let's head back to the analytics page and go 
  to the events tab.

  97
  00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.550
  Filter by action block and surface managed 
  rules.

  98
  00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.150
  You can adjust the time frame if necessary.

  99
  00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.990
  So in previous 24 hours, 
  if you find legitimate traffic being blocked

  100
  00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.110
  by managed rules, don't just disable the 
  entire rule set.

  101
  00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.310
  First, check for common properties between 
  block requests that should be allowed,

  102
  00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.710
  such as the same path like login.

  103
  00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.750
  Then expand the log details for any of these 
  block requests you'd like to follow and copy

  104
  00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.630
  the rule ID. Take note of the managed Rule 
  set name to allow these requests.

  105
  00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.990
  To bypass this rule, you can either add an 
  exception to skip the rule for request to a

  106
  00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.310
  specific path, or you can configure an 
  override to disable the rule.

  107
  00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.430
  Let's see how you would create an exception 
  for specific path in security rules.

  108
  00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.350
  Select create rule. Manage rules.

  109
  00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:09.830
  Enter a name for the exception in field we 
  enter URI path in operator equals in value

  110
  00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.850
  login. Then select Skip specific rules from a 
  managed rule set and then choose Select

  111
  00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.690
  Ruleset for the managed rule you previously 
  identified.

  112
  00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.850
  Choose select rules. Search for the rule you 
  want to skip using the rule ID and select it

  113
  00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.330
  using the checkbox. Select next.

  114
  00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.970
  Review your configuration in rules being 
  skipped and select deploy.

  115
  00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.610
  Now let's look at configuring a rule override 
  for that specific rule.

  116
  00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.450
  The override will change the rule for all 
  incoming requests.

  117
  00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.170
  Select the rule name to open the sidebar, 
  then select view.

  118
  00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.490
  In Security rules, select browse rules.

  119
  00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.890
  Search for the rule you want to skip using 
  the rule ID you copied.

  120
  00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.530
  To disable the rule for all requests, 
  set the status to off.

  121
  00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.330
  Select next and then save.

  122
  00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.370
  This keeps your overall protection in place 
  while allowing valid traffic through for

  123
  00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.090
  known cases. You can now set up application 
  security features to protect your domains and

  124
  00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.890
  applications. For more information, 
  please refer to our developer documentation.
