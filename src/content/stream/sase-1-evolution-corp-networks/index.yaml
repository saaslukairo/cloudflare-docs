  00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.080
  Hi, I'm Simon here at Cloudflare,
  and I'm going to talk about our SASE platform

  2
  00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.660
  to help you modernize your corporate network.

  3
  00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.920
  Many company networks have been built on
  technology that simply can't cope with

  4
  00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.620
  today's security, performance and monitoring
  needs.

  5
  00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.910
  The demands on a corporate network have
  evolved dramatically over the past few years.

  6
  00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.660
  Those working in IT and networking are really
  struggling with the fact that users,

  7
  00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.670
  their devices, and the applications and data
  they need to access are distributed all over

  8
  00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.000
  the place, beyond the perimeter of the
  classic corporate network.

  9
  00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.840
  They're trying to address this problem with
  legacy approaches, which increase cost and

  10
  00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.350
  complexity, and can result in a solution that
  doesn't perform that well,

  11
  00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.390
  leading to really irritated users.

  12
  00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.990
  So in response to these challenges,
  the concept of SASE has evolved.

  13
  00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.230
  It stands for Secure Access Service Edge.

  14
  00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.630
  It's a new approach to networking and
  security,

  15
  00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.770
  which reduces complexity,
  as well as bringing stronger access controls

  16
  00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.100
  and improved performance for the protection
  of applications,

  17
  00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.920
  users, devices and your company data.

  18
  00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.790
  But how does it work? First,
  let's go back and let's look at how

  19
  00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.790
  networking and security solutions used to be
  designed.

  20
  00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.920
  Decades ago, employees would travel into an
  office and use the company's local network,

  21
  00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.420
  which was made up of that network,
  plus also connections to branch offices,

  22
  00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.790
  maybe a data center, and various other
  locations via private leased lines using

  23
  00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.470
  technologies such as MultiProtocol Label
  Switching or MPLS.

  24
  00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.880
  You are paying for expensive private
  connectivity with dedicated bandwidth,

  25
  00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.380
  and typically all Internet access was
  backhauled through these connections to a

  26
  00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.310
  single data center, where firewalls and
  proxies would then inspect the traffic and

  27
  00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.630
  apply the security controls.

  28
  00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.790
  But over time, as the available Internet
  bandwidth increased for less cost,

  29
  00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.320
  the need for these dedicated lines diminished
  and software defined networks,

  30
  00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.780
  commonly known as SD-WAN became popular,
  helping businesses better manage traffic and

  31
  00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.400
  optimize usage of cheaper Internet based
  IPsec tunnels versus these expensive leased

  32
  00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.120
  lines. However, SD-WAN still left businesses
  managing complex on premises appliances and

  33
  00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.690
  having to deal with configuration changes and
  software updates.

  34
  00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.210
  Also, firewalls associated with these SD-WAN
  appliances were relatively limited and often

  35
  00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.870
  paired with extra hardware for a more
  complete security solution.

  36
  00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.860
  While all this was going on,
  the proliferation of devices such as laptops

  37
  00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.550
  and smartphones were allowing employees to
  work from anywhere,

  38
  00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.140
  so VPNs were added into the mix,
  where people could dial up to the VPN and

  39
  00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.130
  access their company network. Often all their
  Internet access was also funneled through

  40
  00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.880
  these VPN connections,
  so the same security policies office users

  41
  00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.870
  had would also be applied to the remote user
  traffic and it all came back through that

  42
  00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.370
  company data center. And this approach is
  really hard to manage with multiple vendors

  43
  00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.880
  and different appliances and different
  dashboards to configure the policies across

  44
  00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.090
  all these technologies,
  and they're not really designed to work well

  45
  00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.130
  in the modern distributed workplace.

  46
  00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.970
  But today, it's not just users and devices
  that have left the office and company

  47
  00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.840
  network, but the applications and data live
  all over the place as well.

  48
  00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.480
  They've migrated out of the data center into
  cloud infrastructure such as AWS,

  49
  00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.100
  Azure and Google. Some applications have been
  completely reimagined as SaaS apps,

  50
  00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.240
  where companies no longer run the servers,
  but just rent access to tenants in large

  51
  00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.150
  software deployments,
  you know, such as Salesforce or Workday and

  52
  00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.750
  Zoom. And users are not just taking a short
  trip away from the office anymore.

  53
  00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.850
  Some people don't even visit one.

  54
  00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.210
  They're working from home,
  in coffee shops, even on airplanes.

  55
  00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.320
  And sometimes they might visit an office,
  yet the same needs still exist:

  56
  00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.340
  the right person should get access to the
  right applications and data.

  57
  00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.770
  Latency or the performance of the application
  should be really high quality and all while

  58
  00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.360
  using secure devices and being protected from
  Internet threats such as phishing campaigns

  59
  00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.500
  and ransomware attacks.

  60
  00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.090
  Because of this constant need for everyone to
  access anything from anywhere,

  61
  00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.280
  SASE architectures evolved where the
  intelligence in the network has migrated out

  62
  00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.860
  of these on premises appliances and now into
  massively scalable global cloud networks.

  63
  00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.710
  So how does Cloudflare SASE platform work?

  64
  00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.320
  Well, first, and probably most importantly,
  we've built a massive network spread all over

  65
  00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.760
  the globe. We've deployed thousands of
  servers in data centers in hundreds of

  66
  00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.720
  cities, creating peering relationships with
  thousands of other networks.

  67
  00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.620
  On top of all of that,
  we've ensured that we have connectivity in

  68
  00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.810
  all the important Internet exchanges.

  69
  00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.980
  These are places where all the big
  connectivity of the Internet is shared.

  70
  00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.800
  To give you an idea of the scale of this huge
  network,

  71
  00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.400
  it handles around 20% of all Internet web
  traffic,

  72
  00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.880
  and it can deal with the largest denial of
  service attacks that have ever been seen.

  73
  00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.900
  The scale and performance of this network is
  really important because from a SASE

  74
  00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.600
  perspective, you're going to be routing all
  your user,

  75
  00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240
  device and network traffic into it.

  76
  00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.070
  Every server in our network runs all the
  capabilities you need to inspect and secure

  77
  00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.740
  traffic. So access controls,
  traffic routing,

  78
  00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.640
  caching, all run on the server that your user
  or network is connecting to.

  79
  00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.870
  So now, instead of all the security controls
  and network logic spread across a variety of

  80
  00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.620
  different vendors and appliances and services
  that you're having to maintain,

  81
  00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.960
  it's centralized in a cloud service that
  operates and points all over the globe,

  82
  00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.980
  so that each user or network is connected to
  a fast local data center.

  83
  00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.210
  And Cloudflare SASE platform is part of a
  greater connectivity cloud.

  84
  00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.130
  So what's a connectivity cloud?

  85
  00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.080
  It's a unified platform of cloud native
  services that spans networking,

  86
  00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.970
  security and application performance,
  and it's designed to help companies regain

  87
  00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.430
  control over their technology infrastructure.

  88
  00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.140
  Our connectivity cloud goes way beyond just
  protecting employees and their access to

  89
  00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.090
  company resources. It's also used to protect
  public assets like websites and APIs.

  90
  00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.090
  In fact, we run one of the world's fastest
  DNS servers.

  91
  00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.660
  We've even exposed the underlying components
  of our platform,

  92
  00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.170
  letting developers write and run their code
  directly on our network.

  93
  00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.700
  Then they can extend our existing services or
  build entirely new applications,

  94
  00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.520
  leading you to an infinite amount of things
  you can build.

  95
  00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.080
  So to summarize Cloudflare SASE platform,
  which runs in our connectivity cloud,

  96
  00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.960
  allows companies to reimagine their company
  network.

  97
  00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.220
  Users connect to Cloudflare's global network
  via a data center that's close to them,

  98
  00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.670
  and that server then ensures that they don't
  access phishing sites on the Internet, or it

  99
  00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.820
  gives them secure access to an internal
  company application.

  100
  00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.150
  All of this is happening in milliseconds
  across our vast network.

  101
  00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.290
  Because we can deliver all these capabilities
  in a single platform instead of different

  102
  00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.550
  vendor solutions, it means that companies can
  centralize all that management into a single,

  103
  00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.900
  well-integrated dashboard.

  104
  00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.040
  This ultimately drives down your cost less
  time used to manage the services,

  105
  00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.280
  less or often no hardware to purchase and
  maintain,

  106
  00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.220
  and it's cheaper to purchase the actual final
  solution.
