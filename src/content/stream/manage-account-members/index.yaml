  00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.560
  Account members are users who have access to 
  your Cloudflare account.

  2
  00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.800
  Each member's access is controlled by 
  policies which define their roles and the

  3
  00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.200
  scope of their permissions.

  4
  00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.480
  In order to grant access to account members.

  5
  00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.880
  You must be a super administrator with a 
  verified email address.

  6
  00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.320
  In this video, we'll walk through how to view 
  members,

  7
  00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.560
  add new members, edit their permissions, 
  resend invitations,

  8
  00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.960
  and revoke access in Cloudflare dashboard.

  9
  00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.240
  Let's first take a look at how to view 
  members.

  10
  00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.040
  Start by logging in to the Cloudflare 
  dashboard and selecting your account.

  11
  00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.560
  Go to Manage Account Members.

  12
  00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.880
  Here you can see the list of current account 
  members.

  13
  00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.120
  Now let's move on to adding account members.

  14
  00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.440
  On the members page to invite someone new, 
  select invite.

  15
  00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.560
  Enter one or more email addresses.

  16
  00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.480
  Define the scope of their access.

  17
  00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.560
  Choose one or more roles such as 
  administrator or billing.

  18
  00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.680
  Click continue to summary.

  19
  00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.240
  Review the details, then select invite.

  20
  00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.680
  If the person already has a Cloudflare 
  account and you're on an enterprise plan,

  21
  00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.120
  you can use Direct Add instead of sending an 
  email invitation.

  22
  00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.250
  If you want to change a member's access and 
  permissions.

  23
  00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.690
  First open the record and select edit, 
  adjust their roles or scope,

  24
  00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.850
  then select continue to summary.

  25
  00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.170
  Review the changes and select update.

  26
  00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.890
  If an invite is pending and the user hasn't 
  accepted,

  27
  00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.330
  this is how you can resend it from the 
  member's page.

  28
  00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.970
  Find a pending user, open the record and 
  choose Resend Invite to revoke someone's

  29
  00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.170
  access. Expand their record.

  30
  00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.050
  Select, revoke and confirm.

  31
  00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.770
  If you were added as a member and you want to 
  remove yourself.

  32
  00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.490
  Go to the member's page, 
  locate your record and select leave.

  33
  00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.850
  If you're a super administrator and you need 
  to leave the account,

  34
  00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.370
  you can invite another super administrator 
  before you remove yourself.

  35
  00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.450
  You cannot delete the account itself, 
  but other super administrators will retain

  36
  00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
  full privileges. Cloudflare also supports 
  user groups,

  37
  00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.650
  which let you manage permissions for a set of 
  members collectively.

  38
  00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.130
  Members inherit all roles assigned to the 
  group in addition to any directly assigned

  39
  00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.130
  permissions. For more information on account 
  members and user groups,
