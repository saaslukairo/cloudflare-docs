  1
  00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.450
  Secure Access Service Edge or SASE solutions
  incorporate Zero Trust Network Access or ZTNA

  2
  00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.610
  to provide access to applications such as an
  internal wiki or a HR system.

  3
  00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.190
  But what about critical high risk services
  such as a database administration tool or

  4
  00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.070
  service requiring access via SSH or RDP?

  5
  00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.800
  In these cases, it's important to be able to
  ensure tight security from the device all the

  6
  00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.020
  way to the application and allow authorized
  users who are using strong authentication on

  7
  00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.240
  trusted devices. Let's say we need to secure
  access to a database admin app such as

  8
  00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.810
  pgAdmin, a common web interface for Postgres
  databases,

  9
  00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.360
  and also access to SSH on the same server.

  10
  00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.530
  Imagine we have an example environment,
  and in it we've already created connectivity

  11
  00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.800
  from the server to Cloudflare,
  using a software agent that maintains a

  12
  00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.230
  secure tunnel from the private network where
  the Pgadmin server is running back to the

  13
  00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.700
  Cloudflare network. No private server IP
  addresses are going to be exposed to the

  14
  00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.960
  Internet. We're essentially connecting this
  server to our new corporate network managed

  15
  00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.400
  by Cloudflare. Once connected,
  there are two methods by which we can access

  16
  00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.040
  our private server. Method one is to create a
  public hostname which resolves to Cloudflare,

  17
  00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.150
  which in turn proxies and routes the traffic
  for that specific hostname to that

  18
  00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.920
  application at the end of our tunnel.

  19
  00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.450
  And this method allows anyone,
  anywhere, on any device to easily access the

  20
  00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.760
  application. But that's not enough.

  21
  00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.970
  In this scenario we want to implement even
  tighter security.

  22
  00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.970
  So method two is to configure the tunnel to
  proxy access only to the server IP with no

  23
  00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.340
  public DNS record, and only for trusted users
  with managed devices that are connected to

  24
  00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.630
  the Cloudflare network.

  25
  00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.780
  So none of this server has any public
  exposure.

  26
  00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.280
  Now, to provide access to only database
  admins,

  27
  00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.260
  there are a few things we need to do.

  28
  00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.010
  We need to use an internal hostname that
  resolves to our server.

  29
  00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.000
  We need to connect to the user device to the
  Cloudflare managed network.

  30
  00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.640
  And we need to identify who the user is and
  if their device has a good security posture.

  31
  00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.910
  So let's first look at how we do the internal
  DNS resolution.

  32
  00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.860
  Because nobody likes using IP addresses to
  access services with the exception of

  33
  00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.690
  1.1.1.1, because it's the easiest IP address
  on the Internet to remember.

  34
  00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.960
  So we really should always be using
  hostnames.

  35
  00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.520
  With Cloudflare, it's as simple as connecting
  a private DNS service to the network,

  36
  00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.630
  and then building a policy that says any
  request from a user or a network,

  37
  00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.660
  anywhere on the Cloudflare network,
  for an internal domain,

  38
  00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.540
  should be answered by that specific DNS
  service.

  39
  00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.860
  In this example, we're going to connect it to
  Cloudflare using exactly the same tunnel

  40
  00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.350
  software that we're using for the database
  server.

  41
  00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.450
  So at this point we have our database admin
  tool that's connected to Cloudflare and we

  42
  00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.770
  have an ability to resolve the IP address of
  that private network using an internal

  43
  00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.720
  hostname. Next, we need to securely connect
  the user device to Cloudflare so that all

  44
  00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.080
  traffic destined for our database server is
  over secure channels.

  45
  00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.890
  We do this using a similar piece of software
  we used on the server,

  46
  00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.080
  but one that's designed for user devices.

  47
  00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.030
  It supports macOS, windows,
  Linux, iOS and Android and connects the

  48
  00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.370
  device to Cloudflare using a secure tunnel.

  49
  00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.000
  But the agent can actually provide
  information about the security posture of the

  50
  00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.510
  device, and we'll talk about that later when
  we look at the policy itself.

  51
  00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.180
  So once the user device is connected to
  Cloudflare,

  52
  00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.710
  requests for private applications are
  resolved using the internal DNS service,

  53
  00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.230
  and traffic is routed from the device through
  Cloudflare through secure tunnels down to the

  54
  00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.540
  private IP the application is running on.

  55
  00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.710
  Now we have secured connectivity all the way
  from the device to the server.

  56
  00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.600
  The last thing we need to do is actually
  write a policy which enforces access only to

  57
  00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.290
  users that you authorize,
  and that the device they're on meets a

  58
  00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.790
  certain level of security.

  59
  00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.690
  We use information from our device agent,
  and also leverage your existing identity and

  60
  00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.000
  device services to help build that policy.

  61
  00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.690
  Cloudflare is typically integrated with one
  or more identity providers.

  62
  00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.020
  Usually, your company has a central directory
  for employees,

  63
  00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.370
  but you can also add more.

  64
  00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.460
  For example, you might manage contractors in
  a different directory.

  65
  00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.260
  Cloudflare can also integrate with XDR
  platforms such as CrowdStrike and

  66
  00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.150
  SentinelOne, and these give us information we
  can use in the policy regards to the security

  67
  00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.170
  posture of the device,
  such as if the device is free of malware.

  68
  00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.590
  For our own agent, we can provide information
  about the device,

  69
  00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.190
  such as is the hard disk encrypted or if the
  local firewall is enabled.

  70
  00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.680
  So now we have all the information about the
  user,

  71
  00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.200
  their device, and how they're connected to
  Cloudflare.

  72
  00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.880
  A policy can be created which only allows
  users who have authenticated using a strong

  73
  00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.340
  factor, such as MFA using a hard token,
  that they also exist in a group such as IT

  74
  00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.750
  administrators, and they're using a secure
  device free of malware.

  75
  00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.390
  This policy sits in front of access to both
  the database admin tool and the SSH service.

  76
  00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.410
  Finally, because you might want to record of
  all access to the database administration

  77
  00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.020
  tool, you can optionally inject a page after
  authentication asking for justification for

  78
  00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.170
  access to the app and that gets audited and
  logged in Cloudflare.

  79
  00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.760
  So in summary, you've seen an example of how
  Cloudflare can protect access to some of your

  80
  00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.000
  critical infrastructure using our SASE
  platform.

  81
  00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.490
  We can help lock down access to servers only
  from highly authenticated users on tightly

  82
  00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.020
  managed devices that must be connected to
  your new corporate network or managed by

  83
  00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.510
  Cloudflare. Well, thanks for watching.
