  00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.200
  <v Speaker1>Hi, I'm Jess from Cloudflare.</v>

  2
  00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
  <v Speaker1>Welcome. In this video,
  you'll learn the basics of Cloudflare WARP.</v>

  3
  00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.480
  <v Speaker1>Our support team will always be here to help,</v>

  4
  00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.240
  <v Speaker1>but this guide is all about empowering you to
  understand and solve issues faster on your</v>

  5
  00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.120
  <v Speaker1>own. We will learn the Cloudflare WARP client
  and how it differs from the consumer version</v>

  6
  00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.240
  <v Speaker1>of WARP, also known as the app 1.1.1.1,
  device profiles,</v>

  7
  00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.800
  <v Speaker1>the different operating modes of WARP,
  split tunneling exclude versus include modes,</v>

  8
  00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.000
  <v Speaker1>and the WARP GUI and its intended versus
  actual state.</v>

  9
  00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.360
  <v Speaker1>These are the basic concepts that will
  prepare you to troubleshoot any issues you</v>

  10
  00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.640
  <v Speaker1>may encounter. Let's get started with What is
  the Cloudflare WARP client?</v>

  11
  00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.920
  <v Speaker1>Cloudflare WARP client allows you to protect
  corporate devices by securely and privately</v>

  12
  00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.800
  <v Speaker1>sending traffic from those devices to
  Cloudflare's global network,</v>

  13
  00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.120
  <v Speaker1>where Cloudflare Gateway can apply advanced
  web filtering.</v>

  14
  00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.800
  <v Speaker1>The consumer version of WARP,
  or the app 1.1.1.1,</v>

  15
  00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.640
  <v Speaker1>is available to the public for free.</v>

  16
  00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.220
  <v Speaker1>The corporate version integrates with
  Cloudflare Zero Trust,</v>

  17
  00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.940
  <v Speaker1>giving your IT team the ability to manage
  security policies,</v>

  18
  00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.940
  <v Speaker1>control traffic routing,
  and monitor usage.</v>

  19
  00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.100
  <v Speaker1>If you're not sure which version of WARP
  you're currently using,</v>

  20
  00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.620
  <v Speaker1>you can tell them apart easily by its color.</v>

  21
  00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.820
  <v Speaker1>The consumer version will display WARP in
  red,</v>

  22
  00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.220
  <v Speaker1>whereas the corporate version will display
  Zero Trust in blue.</v>

  23
  00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.500
  <v Speaker1>If your intention is to use the corporate
  version,</v>

  24
  00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.900
  <v Speaker1>make sure you're seeing a blue Zero Trust
  WARP banner by authenticating with your</v>

  25
  00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.020
  <v Speaker1>Cloudflare Zero Trust organization.</v>

  26
  00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.620
  <v Speaker1>Next, what is the device profile?</v>

  27
  00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.380
  <v Speaker1>A device profile represents a different set
  of parameters assigned to your device,</v>

  28
  00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.220
  <v Speaker1>based on its relationship with the policy
  attributes.</v>

  29
  00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.540
  <v Speaker1>You can create multiple profiles and apply
  different settings based on your user's</v>

  30
  00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.140
  <v Speaker1>identity, the device location,
  and other criteria.</v>

  31
  00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.140
  <v Speaker1>IT administrators can assign different device
  profiles to their users.</v>

  32
  00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.220
  <v Speaker1>For example, depending on office locations,
  teams,</v>

  33
  00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.100
  <v Speaker1>device types, operating systems,
  or other attributes,</v>

  34
  00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.230
  <v Speaker1>users might have different routes that need
  to be excluded from their WARP Tunnel,</v>

  35
  00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.070
  <v Speaker1>or different DNS settings to accommodate
  local development services.</v>

  36
  00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.470
  <v Speaker1>All right, it's important to know that WARP
  client can operate in different modes,</v>

  37
  00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.390
  <v Speaker1>because each mode controls the types of
  traffic sent to Cloudflare Gateway</v>

  38
  00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.430
  <v Speaker1>differently. The WARP mode determines which
  Zero Trust features are available on the</v>

  39
  00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.590
  <v Speaker1>device. Selecting the right mode depends on
  your organization's needs.</v>

  40
  00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.520
  <v Speaker1>For example, for Internet security or remote
  access gateway with WARP or Secure Web</v>

  41
  00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.110
  <v Speaker1>Gateway without DNS filtering would be ideal,</v>

  42
  00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.470
  <v Speaker1>and the latter should only be used in cases
  where Cloudflare cannot control DNS</v>

  43
  00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.110
  <v Speaker1>resolution on the device.</v>

  44
  00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.550
  <v Speaker1>Both Gateway with DoH and Proxy Mode are used
  for Internet filtering.</v>

  45
  00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.710
  <v Speaker1>Gateway with DoH is only DNS traffic,
  while Proxy Mode is only HTTP traffic.</v>

  46
  00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.150
  <v Speaker1>Lastly, Device Information Only mode would be
  useful for clientless access or browser based</v>

  47
  00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.530
  <v Speaker1>remote access to use device posture without
  proxying traffic to Cloudflare.</v>

  48
  00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.050
  <v Speaker1>If you encounter a problem,
  understanding which mode you're in will help</v>

  49
  00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.050
  <v Speaker1>you narrow down where the problem might be.</v>

  50
  00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.290
  <v Speaker1>And that's because WARP modes are
  combinations or absences of particular</v>

  51
  00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.250
  <v Speaker1>features. For example,
  Gateway with WARP includes both DNS and</v>

  52
  00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.810
  <v Speaker1>Tunnel components. So when you're
  troubleshooting,</v>

  53
  00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.770
  <v Speaker1>you have to look at both the DNS and Tunnel
  components as opposed to Gateway with DoH</v>

  54
  00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.890
  <v Speaker1>where you will only have to look at the DNS
  component.</v>

  55
  00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.050
  <v Speaker1>But don't worry, you don't have to memorize
  all of this.</v>

  56
  00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.410
  <v Speaker1>You can always refer to our documentation.</v>

  57
  00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.730
  <v Speaker1>Next up, split tunneling,
  a feature that allows you to control what IP</v>

  58
  00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.850
  <v Speaker1>traffic goes through the WARP virtual
  interface or tunnel.</v>

  59
  00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.730
  <v Speaker1>There are two ways to configure it.</v>

  60
  00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.010
  <v Speaker1>The first mode is exclude IPs and domains.</v>

  61
  00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.730
  <v Speaker1>This is the default setting.</v>

  62
  00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.330
  <v Speaker1>All traffic will be sent to Cloudflare
  Gateway except for IPs and domains you</v>

  63
  00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.970
  <v Speaker1>specify. The second mode is include IPs and
  domains.</v>

  64
  00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.300
  <v Speaker1>Only traffic destined to IPs or domains you
  specify will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway.</v>

  65
  00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.700
  <v Speaker1>All other traffic will bypass Gateway and
  will no longer be filtered by your network or</v>

  66
  00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.340
  <v Speaker1>HTTP policies. Secure Web Gateway without DNS
  filtering and Device Information Only mode</v>

  67
  00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.420
  <v Speaker1>will automatically disable domain based split
  tunneling.</v>

  68
  00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.180
  <v Speaker1>So if you're experiencing issues related to
  domains,</v>

  69
  00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.100
  <v Speaker1>it's good to check your WARP mode.</v>

  70
  00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.380
  <v Speaker1>And lastly, here's a common point of
  confusion.</v>

  71
  00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.940
  <v Speaker1>The toggle button in the WARP GUI shows the
  intended state,</v>

  72
  00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.060
  <v Speaker1>not the actual state. For example,
  if the toggle is on,</v>

  73
  00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.140
  <v Speaker1>it means that the client intends to connect,
  but the actual status may show disconnected</v>

  74
  00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.100
  <v Speaker1>if there's an issue. So always check the
  message below the toggle for the current</v>

  75
  00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.900
  <v Speaker1>connection state. You now understand the
  foundation of WARP client components.</v>

  76
  00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.140
  <v Speaker1>If you want to learn more,
  we also have additional resources on</v>

  77
  00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.380
  <v Speaker1>Cloudflare docs. Thanks for watching and see
  you soon!</v>
