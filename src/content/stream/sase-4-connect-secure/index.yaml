  1
  00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.970
  When looking at Secure Access Service Edge or
  SASE platforms,

  2
  00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.260
  we often talk about a user getting remote
  access into some privately hosted

  3
  00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.070
  application. The focus is often user to
  application,

  4
  00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.830
  where the goal is network micro-segmentation,

  5
  00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.970
  and a user can only access an application
  over a specific address and port.

  6
  00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.570
  But corporate networks exist to carry traffic
  in many other ways.

  7
  00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.230
  Let's take, for example,
  a retail coffee company with many coffee

  8
  00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.790
  shops each providing customers free access to
  the Internet with their guest Wi-Fi,

  9
  00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.940
  but also connecting employees to internal
  applications.

  10
  00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.200
  Each shop also houses point of sale devices,
  security cameras,

  11
  00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.980
  and other network enabled equipment that need
  access to the Internet,

  12
  00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.240
  but also might require access to other
  private networks to back up data or be

  13
  00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.860
  monitored by internal tools.

  14
  00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.440
  IT staff also need to remotely access these
  devices from a corporate office network.

  15
  00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.760
  A lot of this traffic is private and should
  only remain on the corporate network.

  16
  00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.660
  This is where Cloudflare's Connectivity Cloud
  really comes into its own.

  17
  00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.180
  The ability to mesh together different
  networks,

  18
  00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.120
  applications and users no matter where they
  are.

  19
  00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.180
  Let's dive deeper into our coffee company
  example.

  20
  00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.630
  Right. First, they have their main
  headquarters in Seattle.

  21
  00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.770
  Most HQ employees live locally and about half
  travel into the office,

  22
  00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.870
  with the other half working remote at home.

  23
  00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.310
  Second, they have around 40 coffee shops down
  the west coast of America,

  24
  00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.170
  each with a few employees in each.

  25
  00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.910
  And then they have an internal company wiki,
  which is running in a virtual environment in

  26
  00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.150
  Amazon Web Services with its own virtual
  private network.

  27
  00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.340
  And then finally, the security cameras at all
  their coffee shops need to back up data to a

  28
  00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.310
  central service that you've got running on
  servers that you run and host in a rack in a

  29
  00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.440
  data center in San Jose.

  30
  00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.890
  You see how these network locations are all
  quite different.

  31
  00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.330
  Cloudflare has a variety of ways all these
  networks can be connected together.

  32
  00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.960
  Let's start by connecting the headquarters
  network in Seattle.

  33
  00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.640
  We can use something called Magic WAN,
  which is our service that creates IPsec

  34
  00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.920
  tunnels from the headquarters office back to
  the Cloudflare network and assign a private

  35
  00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.720
  network range to it. This is using regular
  standard IPsec protocols and can easily

  36
  00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.630
  leverage functionality in a network,
  router or firewall that exists at

  37
  00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.870
  headquarters. Next, let's look at each coffee
  shop.

  38
  00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.600
  You can ship out to each location a physical
  device running Cloudflare's Magic WAN

  39
  00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.830
  connector. It's essentially a lightweight
  appliance that can be plugged into the local

  40
  00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.780
  ISP router. Each connector creates an IPsec
  connection back to Cloudflare,

  41
  00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.340
  and each device can be administered remotely
  via the Cloudflare dashboard private network.

  42
  00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.920
  Ranges can then be assigned to each coffee
  shop.

  43
  00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.460
  And now we have the beginnings of a new
  modern corporate network.

  44
  00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.920
  So IT admins in the Seattle office can now
  remotely access point of sale devices in each

  45
  00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.850
  coffee shop location. Also,
  because we want to provide customers in each

  46
  00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.670
  shop free Internet access using the guest
  WiFi,

  47
  00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.580
  all traffic from that location is now routed
  through Cloudflare,

  48
  00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.320
  and we can use our secure web gateway to
  block any access to malicious websites,

  49
  00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.710
  and this keeps customers safe while they sip
  their cappuccinos.

  50
  00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.230
  But what about the IT staff working from
  home?

  51
  00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.110
  They're not connected to any of these
  networks. No worries!

  52
  00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.050
  They can use our device agent,
  which connects them to Cloudflare,

  53
  00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.680
  and in turn gives them access to this new
  corporate network as if they were connected

  54
  00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.940
  in headquarters. Now it can manage the
  devices in each coffee shop,

  55
  00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.820
  no matter if they're on a plane,
  sitting in an office,

  56
  00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.650
  or in a coffee shop. When each network or
  user connects,

  57
  00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.590
  it does so to the nearest Cloudflare data
  center,

  58
  00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.290
  which is a key feature of our network where
  we use Anycast IP networking to ensure secure

  59
  00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.540
  connections to users and offices are made to
  the geographically nearest Cloudflare data

  60
  00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.610
  center, so that traffic is then secured and
  optimized as close as possible to the user or

  61
  00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.760
  to that network. And we have data centers in
  over 300 cities and have over 12,000 network

  62
  00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.360
  peering relationships,
  allowing us to ensure fast connectivity from

  63
  00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.410
  user to the network. Think of it like having
  a coffee shop in every neighborhood so

  64
  00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.960
  everyone doesn't have to walk far to get a
  cup of coffee.

  65
  00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.450
  But what about those camera backups?

  66
  00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.200
  Remember, the backup service is running in a
  data center in San Jose.

  67
  00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.120
  Most likely than not. Cloudflare is also
  running our own servers in the same data

  68
  00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.250
  center, and you can offer direct connections
  from Cloudflare to your network switches,

  69
  00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.410
  further extending your corporate network.

  70
  00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.470
  And even if your servers are not in the exact
  same data center,

  71
  00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.610
  we can create a virtual connection directly
  from your rack to the nearest Cloudflare data

  72
  00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.340
  center. Now we've got everything connected.

  73
  00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.290
  Let's add a new application into the mix.

  74
  00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.380
  Let's say the company is launching a new
  internal company wiki,

  75
  00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.220
  and they're running the service in AWS,
  Amazon Web Services.

  76
  00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.640
  We don't need to connect the entire AWS
  private network.

  77
  00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.590
  We just install a software agent on the wiki
  server that creates a secure tunnel back to

  78
  00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.890
  Cloudflare, and connects that application to
  the network,

  79
  00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.390
  that anyone on that network can now access
  the application policies and Cloudflare

  80
  00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.320
  control who can access the wiki,
  ensuring users authenticate with valid

  81
  00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.360
  credentials and are using secured devices.

  82
  00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.930
  You can see that Cloudflare is able to
  connect to a wide variety of networks,

  83
  00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.430
  from the physical office locations to virtual
  application networks in the cloud,

  84
  00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.580
  as well as direct your servers running in
  your data centers.

  85
  00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.730
  So much of the complexity from legacy network
  architectures is abstracted into our

  86
  00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.840
  Connectivity Cloud , making life much easier
  for IT and network admins.

  87
  00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.040
  And once connected to Cloudflare,
  it's not just about routing traffic.

  88
  00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.660
  Firewalling, DNS, Load Balancing,
  protecting from denial of service attacks,

  89
  00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.440
  content caching, and a lot more are all
  easily enabled.

  90
  00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.760
  Any traffic destined for the Internet can
  also be filtered to ensure only access to

  91
  00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.540
  legitimate sites, and blocking any unsafe
  transfer of company data.

  92
  00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.890
  The flexibility of Cloudflare's Connectivity
  Cloud allows you to connect all sorts of

  93
  00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.540
  networks and applications and users.

  94
  00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.070
  It's possible to recreate your classic
  corporate network and then apply on top of it

  95
  00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.320
  all the modern Zero Trust services to ensure
  high security without compromising the user

  96
  00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.360
  experience. Well, thanks for watching.
