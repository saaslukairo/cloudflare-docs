During Birthday Week, we announced that [single sign-on (SSO) is available for free](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enterprise-grade-features-for-all/) to everyone who signs in with a custom email domain and maintains a compatible [identity provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/). SSO minimizes user friction around login and provides the strongest security posture available. At the time, this could only be configured using the API.

Today, we are launching a new user experience which allows users to manage their SSO configuration from within the Cloudflare dashboard. You can access this by going to **Manage account** > **Members** > **Settings**.
