As Cloudflare's platform has grown, so has the need for precise, role-based access control. We’ve redesigned the Member Management experience in the Dashboard to help administrators more easily discover, assign, and refine permissions for specific principals.


### What's New

**Refreshed member invite flow**

We overhauled the Invite Members UI to simplify inviting users and assigning permissions.

**Refreshed Members Overview Page**
 
We've updated the Members Overview Page to clearly display:
- Member 2FA status
- Which members hold Super Admin privileges
- API access settings per member
- Member onboarding state (accepted vs pending invite)

**New Member Permission Policies Details View**

We've created a new member details screen that shows all permission policies associated with a member; including policies inherited from group associations to make it easier for members to understand the effective permissions they have.

**Improved Member Permission Workflow** 

We redesigned the permission management experience to make it faster and easier for administrators to review roles and grant access.

**Account-scoped Policies Restrictions Relaxed**

Previously, customers could only associate a single account-scoped policy with a member. We've relaxed this restriction, and now Administrators can now assign multiple account-scoped policies to the same member; bringing policy assignment behavior in-line with user-groups and providing greater flexibility in managing member permissions.
