Earlier this year, we announced the launch of the new [Terraform v5 Provider](/changelog/2025-02-03-terraform-v5-provider/). We are aware of the high mumber of [issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare) reported by the Cloudflare community related to the v5 release, with 13.5% of resources impacted. We have committed to releasing improvements on a 2 week cadeance to ensure it's stability and relability, including the v5.7 release.

Thank you for continuing to raise issues and please keep an eye on this changelog for more information about upcoming releases.

If you have an unaddressed issue with the provider, we encourage you to check the [open issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues) and open a new one if one does not already exist for what you are experiencing.

### Upgrading

We suggest holding on migration to v5 while we work on stablization of the v5 provider. This will ensure Cloudflare can work ahead and avoid any blocking issues.

If you'd like more information on migrating from v4 to v5, please make use of the
[migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade). We have
provided automated migration scripts using Grit which simplify the transition, although these do not support implementations which
use Terraform modules, so customers making use of modules need to migrate manually. Please make use of `terraform plan` to test
your changes before applying, and let us know if you encounter any additional issues by reporting to our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare).
