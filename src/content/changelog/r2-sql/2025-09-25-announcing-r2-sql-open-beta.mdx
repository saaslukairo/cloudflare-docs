Today, we're launching the **open beta** for [R2 SQL](/r2-sql/): A serverless, distributed query engine that can efficiently analyze petabytes of data in [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) tables managed by [R2 Data Catalog](/r2/data-catalog).

R2 SQL is ideal for exploring analytical and time-series data stored in R2, such as logs, events from [Pipelines](/pipelines/), or clickstream and user behavior data.

If you already have a table in R2 Data Catalog, running queries is as simple as:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 sql query YOUR_WAREHOUSE "
SELECT
    user_id,
    event_type,
    value
FROM events.user_events
WHERE event_type = 'CHANGELOG' or event_type = 'BLOG'
  AND __ingest_ts > '2025-09-24T00:00:00Z'
ORDER BY __ingest_ts DESC
LIMIT 100"
```

To get started with R2 SQL, check out our [getting started guide](/r2-sql/get-started/) or learn more about supported features in the [SQL reference](/r2-sql/sql-reference/). For a technical deep dive into how we built R2 SQL, read our [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/r2-sql-deep-dive/).
