New instance types provide up to 4 vCPU, 12 GiB of memory, and 20 GB of disk per container instance.

| Instance Type | vCPU | Memory  | Disk  |
| ------------- | ---- | ------  | ----  |
| lite          | 1/16 | 256 MiB | 2 GB  |
| basic         | 1/4  | 1 GiB   | 4 GB  |
| standard-1    | 1/2  | 4 GiB   | 8 GB  |
| standard-2    | 1    | 6 GiB   | 12 GB |
| standard-3    | 2    | 8 GiB   | 16 GB |
| standard-4    | 4    | 12 GiB  | 20 GB |

The `dev` and `standard` instance types are preserved for backward compatibility and are aliases for `lite` and `standard-1`, respectively. The `standard-1` instance type now provides up to 8 GB of disk instead of only 4 GB.

See the [getting started guide](/containers/get-started/) to deploy your first Container,
and the [limits documentation](/containers/platform-details/limits/) for more details on the available instance types and limits.
