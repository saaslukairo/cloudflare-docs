You can now run more Containers concurrently with higher limits on CPU, memory, and disk.

| Limit                                          | New Limit | Previous Limit |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Memory for concurrent live Container instances | 400GiB    | 40GiB          |
| vCPU for concurrent live Container instances   | 100       | 20             |
| Disk for concurrent live Container instances   | 2TB       | 100GB          |

You can now run 1000 instances of the `dev` instance type, 400 instances of `basic`, or 100 instances of `standard` concurrently.

This opens up new possibilities for running larger-scale workloads on Containers.

See the [getting started guide](/containers/get-started/) to deploy your first Container,
and the [limits documentation](/containers/platform-details/limits/) for more details on the available instance types and limits.
