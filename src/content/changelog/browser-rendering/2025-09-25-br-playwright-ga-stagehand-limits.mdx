We’re shipping three updates to Browser Rendering:
- Playwright support is now Generally Available and synced with [Playwright v1.55](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#version-155), giving you a stable foundation for critical automation and AI-agent workflows.
- We’re also adding [Stagehand support (Beta)](/browser-rendering/stagehand/) so you can combine code with natural language instructions to build more resilient automations.
- Finally, we’ve tripled [limits](/browser-rendering/limits/#workers-paid) for paid plans across both the [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) and [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/) to help you scale.

To get started with Stagehand, refer to the [Stagehand](/browser-rendering/stagehand/) example that uses Stagehand and [Workers AI](/workers-ai/) to search for a movie on this [example movie directory](https://demo.playwright.dev/movies), extract its details using natural language (title, year, rating, duration, and genre), and return the information along with a screenshot of the webpage.

```ts title="Stagehand example"
const stagehand = new Stagehand({
	env: "LOCAL",
	localBrowserLaunchOptions: { cdpUrl: endpointURLString(env.BROWSER) },
	llmClient: new WorkersAIClient(env.AI),
	verbose: 1,
});

await stagehand.init();
const page = stagehand.page;

await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/movies');

// if search is a multi-step action, stagehand will return an array of actions it needs to act on
const actions = await page.observe('Search for "Furiosa"');
for (const action of actions)
	await page.act(action);

await page.act('Click the search result');

// normal playwright functions work as expected
await page.waitForSelector('.info-wrapper .cast');

let movieInfo = await page.extract({
	instruction: 'Extract movie information',
	schema: z.object({
		title: z.string(),
		year: z.number(),
		rating: z.number(),
		genres: z.array(z.string()),
		duration: z.number().describe("Duration in minutes"),
	}),
});

await stagehand.close();
```
