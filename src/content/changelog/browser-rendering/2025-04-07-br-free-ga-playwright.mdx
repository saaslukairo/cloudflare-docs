We’re excited to announce Browser Rendering is now available on the [Workers Free plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/developer-platform/), making it even easier to prototype and experiment with web search and headless browser use-cases when building applications on Workers.

The Browser Rendering **[REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) is now Generally Available**, allowing you to control browser instances from outside of Workers applications. We've added three new endpoints to help automate more browser tasks:

- **Extract structured data** – Use `/json` to retrieve structured data from a webpage.
- **Retrieve links** – Use `/links` to pull all links from a webpage.
- **Convert to Markdown** – Use `/markdown` to convert webpage content into Markdown format.

For example, to fetch the Markdown representation of a webpage:

```bash title="Markdown example"
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<accountId>/browser-rendering/markdown' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }'

```

For the full list of endpoints, check out our [REST API documentation](/browser-rendering/rest-api/). You can also interact with Browser Rendering via the [Cloudflare TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript).

We also recently landed support for [Playwright](/browser-rendering/playwright/) in Browser Rendering for browser automation from Cloudflare [Workers](/workers/), in addition to [Puppeteer](/browser-rendering/puppeteer/), giving you more flexibility to test across different browser environments.
