We’ve launched pricing for [Browser Rendering](/browser-rendering/), including a free tier and a pay-as-you-go model that scales with your needs. Starting **August 20, 2025**, Cloudflare will begin billing for Browser Rendering.

There are two ways to use Browser Rendering. Depending on the method you use, here’s how billing will work:
- [**REST API**](/browser-rendering/rest-api/): Charged for **Duration** only ($/browser hour)
- [**Workers Bindings**](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/): Charged for both **Duration** and **Concurrency** ($/browser hour and # of concurrent browsers)
