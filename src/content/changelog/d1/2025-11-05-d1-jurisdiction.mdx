You can now set a [jurisdiction](/d1/configuration/data-location/) when creating a D1 database to guarantee where your database runs and stores data. Jurisdictions can help you comply with data localization regulations such as GDPR. Supported jurisdictions include `eu` and `fedramp`.

A jurisdiction can only be set at database creation time via wrangler, REST API or the UI and cannot be added/updated after the database already exists.

```sh
npx wrangler@latest d1 create db-with-jurisdiction --jurisdiction eu
```

```
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/d1/database" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"name": "db-wth-jurisdiction", "jurisdiction": "eu" }'
```
