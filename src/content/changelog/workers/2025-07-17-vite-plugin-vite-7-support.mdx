[Vite 7](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite7) is now supported in the Cloudflare Vite plugin.
See the [Vite changelog](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#700-2025-06-24) for a list of changes.

Note that the minimum Node.js versions supported by Vite 7 are 20.19 and 22.12.
We continue to support Vite 6 so you do not need to immediately upgrade.
