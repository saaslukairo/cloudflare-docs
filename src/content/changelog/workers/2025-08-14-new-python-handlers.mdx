We are changing how Python Workers are structured by default. Previously, handlers were defined at the top-level of a module as `on_fetch`, `on_scheduled`, etc. methods, but now they live in an entrypoint class.

Here's an example of how to now define a Worker with a fetch handler:

```python
from workers import Response, WorkerEntrypoint

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        return Response("Hello World!")
```

To keep using the old-style handlers, you can specify the `disable_python_no_global_handlers` compatibility flag in your wrangler file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
compatibility_flags = [ "disable_python_no_global_handlers" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

Consult the [Python Workers documentation](/workers/languages/python/) for more details.
