Workers, including those using [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/) and [Browser Rendering](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/), may now process WebSocket messages up to 32 MiB in size. Previously, this limit was 1 MiB.

This change allows Workers to handle use cases requiring large message sizes, such as processing Chrome Devtools Protocol messages.

For more information, please see the [Durable Objects startup limits](/durable-objects/platform/limits/#SQLite-backed-Durable-Objects-general-limits).
