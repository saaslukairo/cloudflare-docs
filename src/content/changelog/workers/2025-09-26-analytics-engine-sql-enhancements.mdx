You can now perform more powerful queries directly in [Workers Analytics Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/) with a major expansion of our SQL function library.

Workers Analytics Engine allows you to ingest and store high-cardinality data at scale (such as custom analytics) and query your data through a simple SQL API. 

Today, we've expanded Workers Analytics Engine's SQL capabilities with several new functions: 

[**New aggregate functions:**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/)
- `argMin()` - Returns the value associated with the minimum in a group
- `argMax()` - Returns the value associated with the maximum in a group
- `topK()` - Returns an array of the most frequent values in a group
- `topKWeighted()` - Returns an array of the most frequent values in a group using weights
- `first_value()` - Returns the first value in an ordered set of values within a partition
- `last_value()` - Returns the last value in an ordered set of values within a partition

[**New bit functions:**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/bit-functions/)
- `bitAnd()` - Returns the bitwise AND of two expressions
- `bitCount()` - Returns the number of bits set to one in the binary representation of a number
- `bitHammingDistance()` - Returns the number of bits that differ between two numbers
- `bitNot()` - Returns a number with all bits flipped
- `bitOr()` - Returns the inclusive bitwise OR of two expressions
- `bitRotateLeft()` - Rotates all bits in a number left by specified positions
- `bitRotateRight()` - Rotates all bits in a number right by specified positions
- `bitShiftLeft()` - Shifts all bits in a number left by specified positions
- `bitShiftRight()` - Shifts all bits in a number right by specified positions
- `bitTest()` - Returns the value of a specific bit in a number
- `bitXor()` - Returns the bitwise exclusive-or of two expressions

[**New mathematical functions:**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/mathematical-functions/)
- `abs()` - Returns the absolute value of a number
- `log()` - Computes the natural logarithm of a number
- `round()` - Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places  
- `ceil()` - Rounds a number up to the nearest integer
- `floor()` - Rounds a number down to the nearest integer
- `pow()` - Returns a number raised to the power of another number

[**New string functions:**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/string-functions/)
- `lowerUTF8()` - Converts a string to lowercase using UTF-8 encoding
- `upperUTF8()` - Converts a string to uppercase using UTF-8 encoding

[**New encoding functions:**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/encoding-functions/)
- `hex()` - Converts a number to its hexadecimal representation
- `bin()` - Converts a string to its binary representation 

[**New type conversion functions:**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/type-conversion-functions/)
- `toUInt8()` - Converts any numeric expression, or expression resulting in a string representation of a decimal, into an unsigned 8 bit integer
