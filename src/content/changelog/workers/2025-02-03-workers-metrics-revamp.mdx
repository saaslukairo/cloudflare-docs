We've revamped the [Workers Metrics dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/services/view/:worker/production/metrics/).

Now you can easily compare metrics across Worker versions, understand the current state of a [gradual deployment](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), and review key Workers metrics in a single view. This new interface enables you to:

- Drag-and-select using a graphical timepicker for precise metric selection.

- Use histograms to visualize cumulative metrics, allowing you to bucket and compare rates over time.
- Focus on Worker versions by directly interacting with the version numbers in the legend.

- Monitor and compare active gradual deployments.
- Track error rates across versions with grouping both by version and by invocation status.
- Measure how [Smart Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) improves request duration.
