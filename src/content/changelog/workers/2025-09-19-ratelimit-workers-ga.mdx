[Rate Limiting within Cloudflare Workers](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/rate-limit/) is now Generally Available (GA). 

The `ratelimit` binding is now stable and recommended for all production workloads. Existing deployments using the unsafe binding will continue to function to allow for a smooth transition.

For more details, refer to [Workers Rate Limiting](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/rate-limit/) documentation.
