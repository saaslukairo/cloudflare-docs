You can now create [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/) using
[Python Workers](/workers/languages/python/). A Durable Object is a special kind of
Cloudflare Worker which uniquely combines compute with storage, enabling stateful
long-running applications which run close to your users. For more info see
[here](/durable-objects/concepts/what-are-durable-objects/).

You can define a Durable Object in Python in a similar way to JavaScript:

```python
from workers import DurableObject, Response, WorkerEntrypoint

from urllib.parse import urlparse

class MyDurableObject(DurableObject):
    def __init__(self, ctx, env):
        self.ctx = ctx
        self.env = env

    def fetch(self, request):
        result = self.ctx.storage.sql.exec("SELECT 'Hello, World!' as greeting").one()
        return Response(result.greeting)

class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        url = urlparse(request.url)
        id = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.idFromName(url.path)
        stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(id)
        greeting = await stub.fetch(request.url)
        return greeting
```

Define the Durable Object in your Wrangler configuration file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "MY_DURABLE_OBJECT"
class_name = "MyDurableObject"
```

</WranglerConfig>

Then define the storage backend for your Durable Object:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
new_sqlite_classes = ["MyDurableObject"] # Array of new classes
```

</WranglerConfig>

Then test your new Durable Object locally by running `wrangler dev`:

```
npx wrangler dev
```

Consult the [Durable Objects documentation](/durable-objects/) for more details.
