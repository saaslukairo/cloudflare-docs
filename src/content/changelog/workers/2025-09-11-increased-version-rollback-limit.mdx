The number of recent versions available for a Worker rollback has been increased from 10 to 100.

This allows you to: 

* Promote any of the 100 most recent versions to be the active deployment. 

* Split traffic using [gradual deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/) between your latest code and any of the 100 most recent versions.

You can do this through the Cloudflare dashboard or with [Wrangler's rollback command](/workers/wrangler/commands/#rollback)
