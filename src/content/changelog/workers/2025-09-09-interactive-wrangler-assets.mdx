Deploying static site to Workers is now easier. When you run `wrangler deploy [directory]` or `wrangler deploy --assets [directory]` without an existing [configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/), [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/) now guides you through the deployment process with interactive prompts.

## Before and after

**Before:** Required remembering multiple flags and parameters
```bash
wrangler deploy --assets ./dist --compatibility-date 2025-09-09 --name my-project
```

**After:** Simple directory deployment with guided setup
```bash
wrangler deploy dist
# Interactive prompts handle the rest as shown in the example flow below
```

## What's new

**Interactive prompts for missing configuration:**
- Wrangler detects when you're trying to deploy a directory of static assets
- Prompts you to confirm the deployment type
- Asks for a project name (with smart defaults)
- Automatically sets the compatibility date to today

**Automatic configuration generation:**
- Creates a `wrangler.jsonc` file with your deployment settings
- Stores your choices for future deployments
- Eliminates the need to remember complex command-line flags

## Example workflow

```bash
# Deploy your built static site
wrangler deploy dist

# Wrangler will prompt:
✔ It looks like you are trying to deploy a directory of static assets only. Is this correct? … yes
✔ What do you want to name your project? … my-astro-site

# Automatically generates a wrangler.jsonc file and adds it to your project:
{
  "name": "my-astro-site",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-09-09",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "dist"
  }
}

# Next time you run wrangler deploy, this will use the configuration in your newly generated wrangler.jsonc file
wrangler deploy
```

## Requirements

- You must use Wrangler version 4.24.4 or later in order to use this feature
