To prevent the accidental exposure of applications, we've updated how [Worker preview URLs](/workers/configuration/previews/) (`<PREVIEW>-<WORKER_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`) are handled. We made this change to ensure preview URLs are only active when intentionally configured, improving the default security posture of your Workers. 

## One-Time Update for Workers with workers.dev Disabled
We performed a one-time update to disable preview URLs for existing Workers where the [workers.dev subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) was also disabled.

Because preview URLs were historically enabled by default, users who had intentionally disabled their workers.dev route may not have realized their Worker was still accessible at a separate preview URL. This update was performed to ensure that using a preview URL is always an intentional, opt-in choice.

If your Worker was affected, its preview URL (`<PREVIEW>-<WORKER_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`) will now direct to an informational page explaining this change.

**How to Re-enable Your Preview URL**

If your preview URL was disabled, you can re-enable it [via the Cloudflare dashboard](/workers/configuration/previews/#toggle-preview-urls-enable-or-disable) by navigating to your Worker's Settings page and toggling on the Preview URL.

Alternatively, you can use Wrangler by adding the `preview_urls = true` setting to your Wrangler file and redeploying the Worker.

<WranglerConfig>
```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "preview_urls": true
}
```
</WranglerConfig>

**Note:** You can set `preview_urls = true` with any Wrangler version that supports the preview URL flag (v3.91.0+). However, we recommend updating to v4.34.0 or newer, as this version defaults `preview_urls` to false, ensuring preview URLs are always enabled by explicit choice.
