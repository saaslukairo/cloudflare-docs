Today [we announced the public beta](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/discussions/9660) of [remote bindings](/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings) for local development. With remote bindings, you can now connect to deployed resources like [R2 buckets](/r2/) and [D1 databases](/d1/) while running Worker code on your local machine. This means you can test your local code changes against real data and services, without the overhead of deploying for each iteration.

## Example configuration

To enable remote mode, add `"experimental_remote" : true` to each binding that you want to rely on a remote resource running on Cloudflare:

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
	"name": "my-worker",
	"compatibility_date": "$today",

	"r2_buckets": [
		{
			"bucket_name": "screenshots-bucket",
			"binding": "screenshots_bucket",
			"experimental_remote": true,
		},
	],
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

When remote bindings are configured, your Worker **still executes locally**, but all binding calls are proxied to the deployed resource that runs on Cloudflare's network.

**You can try out remote bindings for local development today with:**

- [Wrangler v4.20.3](/workers/development-testing/#using-wrangler-with-remote-bindings): Use the `wrangler dev --x-remote-bindings` command.
- The [Cloudflare Vite Plugin](/workers/development-testing/#using-vite-with-remote-bindings): Refer to the documentation for how to enable in your Vite config.
- The [Cloudflare Vitest Plugin](/workers/development-testing/#using-vitest-with-remote-bindings): Refer to the documentation for how to enable in your Vitest config.
