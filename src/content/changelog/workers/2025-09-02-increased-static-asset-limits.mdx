You can now upload up to **100,000 static assets** per Worker version

- Paid and Workers for Platforms users can now upload up to **100,000 static assets** per Worker version, a 5x increase from the previous limit of 20,000.
- Customers on the free plan still have the same limit as before — 20,000 static assets per version of your Worker
- The individual file size limit of 25 MiB remains unchanged for all customers.

This increase allows you to build larger applications with more static assets without hitting limits.

### Wrangler

To take advantage of the increased limits, you must use **Wrangler version 4.34.0 or higher**.
Earlier versions of Wrangler will continue to enforce the previous 20,000 file limit.
