import { Render } from "~/components";

Enable automatic tracing on your Workers, giving you detailed metadata and timing information for every operation your Worker performs.

![Tracing example](~/assets/images/workers-observability/R2_Screenshot.png)

Tracing helps you identify performance bottlenecks, resolve errors, and understand how your Worker interacts with other services on the Workers platform. You can now answer questions like:

- Which calls are slowing down my application?
- Which queries to my database take the longest?
- What happened within a request that resulted in an error?

**You can now:**

- View traces alongside your logs in the Workers Observability dashboard
- Export traces (and correlated logs) to any [OTLP-compatible destination](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/), such as [Honeycomb](/workers/observability/exporting-opentelemetry-data/honeycomb/), [Sentry](/workers/observability/exporting-opentelemetry-data/sentry/) or [Grafana](/workers/observability/exporting-opentelemetry-data/grafana-cloud/), by configuring a tracing destination in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/destinations)
- Analyze and query across span attributes (operation type, status, duration, errors)

## To get started, set:

```jsonc
{
	"observability": {
		"tracing": {
			"enabled": true,
		},
	},
}
```
