You can now list all vector identifiers in a Vectorize index using the new `list-vectors` operation. This enables bulk operations, auditing, and data migration workflows through paginated requests that maintain snapshot consistency.

The operation is available via Wrangler CLI and REST API. Refer to the [list-vectors best practices guide](/vectorize/best-practices/list-vectors/) for detailed usage guidance.
