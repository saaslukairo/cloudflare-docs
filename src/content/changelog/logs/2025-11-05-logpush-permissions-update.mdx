[Permissions](/logs/logpush/permissions/) for managing Logpush jobs related to [Zero Trust datasets](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/) (Access, Gateway, and DEX) have been updated to improve data security and enforce appropriate access controls.

To view, create, update, or delete Logpush jobs for Zero Trust datasets, users must now have both of the following permissions:

- Logs Edit
- Zero Trust: PII Read

:::note
Update your UI, API or Terraform configurations to include the new permissions. Requests to Zero Trust datasets will fail due to insufficient access without the additional permission.
