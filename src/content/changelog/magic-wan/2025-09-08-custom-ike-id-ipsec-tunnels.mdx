Now, Magic WAN customers can configure a custom IKE ID for their IPsec tunnels. Customers that are using Magic WAN and a VeloCloud SD-WAN device together can utilize this new feature to create a high availability configuration.

This feature is available via API only. Customers can read the Magic WAN documentation to learn more about the [Custom IKE ID feature and the API call to configure it](/magic-wan/configuration/common-settings/custom-ike-id-ipsec/).
