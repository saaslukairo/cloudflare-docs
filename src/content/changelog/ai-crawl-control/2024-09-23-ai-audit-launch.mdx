Every site on Cloudflare now has access to [**AI Audit**](/ai-crawl-control/), which summarizes the crawling behavior of popular and known AI services.

You can use this data to:

- Understand how and how often crawlers access your site (and which content is the most popular).
- Block specific AI bots accessing your site.
- Use Cloudflare to enforce your `robots.txt` policy via an automatic WAF rule.
