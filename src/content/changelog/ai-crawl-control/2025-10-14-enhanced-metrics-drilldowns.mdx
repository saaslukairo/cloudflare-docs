AI Crawl Control now provides enhanced metrics and CSV data exports to help you better understand AI crawler activity across your sites.

## What's new

### Track crawler requests over time

Visualize crawler activity patterns over time, and group data by different dimensions:

- **By Crawler** — Track activity from individual AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Bytespider)
- **By Category** — Analyze crawler purpose or type
- **By Operator** — Discover which companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, ByteDance) are crawling your site
- **By Host** — Break down activity across multiple subdomains
- **By Status Code** — Monitor HTTP response codes to crawlers (200s, 300s, 400s, 500s)

### Analyze referrer data (Paid plans)

- View top referrers driving traffic to your site
- Understand discovery patterns and content popularity from AI operators
