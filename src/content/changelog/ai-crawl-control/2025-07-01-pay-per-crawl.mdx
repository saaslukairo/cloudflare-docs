We are introducing a new feature of [AI Crawl Control](/ai-crawl-control/) — Pay Per Crawl. [Pay Per Crawl](/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/) enables site owners to require payment from AI crawlers every time the crawlers access their content, thereby fostering a fairer Internet by enabling site owners to control and monetize how their content gets used by AI.

**For Site Owners:**

- Set pricing and select which crawlers to charge for content access
- Manage payments via Stripe
- Monitor analytics on successful content deliveries

**For AI Crawler Owners:**

- Use HTTP headers to request and accept pricing
- Receive clear confirmations on charges for accessed content
