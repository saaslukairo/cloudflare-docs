[Log Explorer](/log-explorer/) now supports logging and filtering on header or cookie fields in the [`http_requests` dataset](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/http_requests/).

Create a custom field to log desired header or cookie values into the `http_requests` dataset and Log Explorer will import these as searchable fields. Once configured, use the custom SQL editor in Log Explorer to view or filter on these requests.
