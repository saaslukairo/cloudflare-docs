Directly from [Log Search](/log-explorer/log-search/) results, customers can pivot to other parts of the Cloudflare dashboard to immediately take action as a result of their investigation. 

From the `http_requests` or `fw_events` dataset results, right click on an IP Address or JA3 Fingerprint to pivot to the Investigate portal to lookup the reputation of an IP address or JA3 fingerprint.
