**This week's update**

This week, new critical vulnerabilities were disclosed in Next.js’s image optimization functionality, exposing a broad range of production environments to risks of data exposure and cache manipulation.

**Key Findings**

- CVE-2025-55173: Arbitrary file download from the server via image optimization.

- CVE-2025-57752: Cache poisoning leading to unauthorized data disclosure.

**Impact**

Exploitation could expose sensitive files, leak user or backend data, and undermine application trust. Given Next.js’s wide use, immediate patching and cache hardening are strongly advised.
