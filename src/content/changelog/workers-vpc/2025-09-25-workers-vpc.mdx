title: Announcing Workers VPC Services (Beta)
description: Access private resources in your VPC from Cloudflare Workers
date: 2025-11-05
---

**Workers VPC Services** is now available, enabling your Workers to securely access resources in your private networks, without having to expose them on the public Internet.

## What's new

- **VPC Services**: Create secure connections to internal APIs, databases, and services using familiar Worker binding syntax
- **Multi-cloud Support**: Connect to resources in private networks in any external cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) or on-premise using Cloudflare Tunnels

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		// Perform application logic in Workers here

		// Sample call to an internal API running on ECS in AWS using the binding
		const response = await env.AWS_VPC_ECS_API.fetch("https://internal-host.example.com");

		// Additional application logic in Workers
		return new Response();
	},
};
```

## Getting started

Set up a Cloudflare Tunnel, create a VPC Service, add service bindings to your Worker, and access private resources securely. [Refer to the documentation](/workers-vpc/) to get started.
