Zero Trust now includes **Data security analytics**, providing you with unprecedented visibility into your organization sensitive data. 

The new dashboard includes:

* **Sensitive Data Movement Over Time:**
    - See patterns and trends in how sensitive data moves across your environment. This helps understand where data is flowing and identify common paths.

* **Sensitive Data at Rest in SaaS & Cloud:**
    - View an inventory of sensitive data stored within your corporate SaaS applications (for example, Google Drive, Microsoft 365) and cloud accounts (such as AWS S3).

* **DLP Policy Activity:**
    - Identify which of your Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies are being triggered most often.
    - See which specific users are responsible for triggering DLP policies.
