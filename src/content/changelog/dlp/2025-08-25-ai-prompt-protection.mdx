You now have access to a comprehensive suite of capabilities to secure your organization's use of generative AI. AI prompt protection introduces four key features that work together to provide deep visibility and granular control.

1. **Prompt Detection for AI Applications**

DLP can now natively detect and inspect user prompts submitted to popular AI applications, including **Google Gemini**, **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Perplexity**.

2. **Prompt Analysis and Topic Classification**

Our DLP engine performs deep analysis on each prompt, applying [topic classification](/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/detection-entries/#ai-prompt-topics). These topics are grouped into two evaluation categories:

        - **Content:** PII, Source Code, Credentials and Secrets, Financial Information, and Customer Data.

        - **Intent:** Jailbreak attempts, requests for malicious code, or attempts to extract PII.

To help you apply these topics quickly, we have also released five new predefined profiles (for example, AI Prompt: AI Security, AI Prompt: PII) that bundle these new topics.

3. **Granular Guardrails**

    You can now build guardrails using Gateway HTTP policies with [application granular controls](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/#application-granular-controls). Apply a DLP profile containing an [AI prompt topic detection](/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/detection-entries/#ai-prompt-topics) to individual AI applications (for example, ```ChatGPT```) and specific user actions (for example, ```SendPrompt```) to block sensitive prompts.

 4. **Full Prompt Logging**
   
    To aid in incident investigation, an optional setting in your Gateway policy allows you to [capture prompt logs](/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-policies/logging-options/#log-generative-ai-prompt-content) to store the full interaction of prompts that trigger a policy match. To make investigations easier, logs can be filtered by ```conversation_id```, allowing you to reconstruct the full context of an interaction that led to a policy violation.
