title: Send forensic copies to storage without DLP profiles
description: HTTP policies can now be configured to send forensic copies for all allow and block policies.

You can now [send DLP forensic copies](/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-policies/logging-options/#send-http-requests-to-logpush-destination/) to third-party storage for any HTTP policy with an `Allow` or `Block` action, without needing to include a DLP profile. This change increases flexibility for data handling and forensic investigation use cases.

By default, Gateway will send all matched HTTP requests to your configured DLP Forensic Copy jobs.
