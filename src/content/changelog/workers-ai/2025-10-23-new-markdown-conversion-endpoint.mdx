Developers can now programmatically retrieve a list of all file formats supported by the [Markdown Conversion utility](/workers-ai/features/markdown-conversion/) in Workers AI.

You can use the [`env.AI`](/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/) binding:

```typescript
await env.AI.toMarkdown().supported()
```

Or call the REST API:

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/tomarkdown/supported \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}'
```

Both return a list of file formats that users can convert into Markdown:

```json
[
	{
		"extension": ".pdf",
		"mimeType": "application/pdf",
	},
	{
		"extension": ".jpeg",
		"mimeType": "image/jpeg",
	},
	...
]
```
