You can now safely open email attachments to view and investigate them.

What this means is that messages now have a **Attachments** section. Here, you can view processed attachments and their classifications (for example, _Malicious_, _Suspicious_, _Encrypted_). Next to each attachment, a **Browser Isolation** icon allows your team to safely open the file in a **clientless, isolated browser** with no risk to the analyst or your environment.

To use this feature, you must:

- Enable **Clientless Web Isolation** in your Zero Trust settings.
- Have **Browser Isolation (BISO)** seats assigned.

For more details, refer to our [setup guide](/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/).

Some attachment types may not render in Browser Isolation. If there is a file type that you would like to be opened with Browser Isolation, reach out to your Cloudflare contact.

This feature is available across these Email security packages:

- **Advantage**
- **Enterprise**
- **Enterprise + PhishGuard**
