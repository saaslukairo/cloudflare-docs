You can now investigate links in emails with Cloudflare Security Center to generate a report containing a myriad of technical details: a phishing scan, SSL certificate data, HTTP request and response data, page performance data, DNS records, what technologies and libraries the page uses, and more.

From **Investigation**, go to **View details**, and look for the **Links identified** section. Select **Open in Security Center** next to each link. **Open in Security Center** allows your team to quickly generate a detailed report about the link with no risk to the analyst or your environment.

For more details, refer to [Open links](/cloudflare-one/email-security/investigation/search-email/#open-links).

This feature is available across these Email security packages:
