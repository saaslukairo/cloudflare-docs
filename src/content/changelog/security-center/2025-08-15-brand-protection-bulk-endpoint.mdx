[Brand Protection](/security-center/brand-protection/) detects domains that may be impersonating your brand — from common misspellings (`cloudfalre.com`) to malicious concatenations (`cloudflare-okta.com`). Saved search queries run continuously and alert you when suspicious domains appear.

You can now create and save multiple queries in a single step, streamlining setup and management. Available now via the [Brand Protection bulk query creation API](/api/resources/brand_protection/subresources/queries/methods/bulk/).
