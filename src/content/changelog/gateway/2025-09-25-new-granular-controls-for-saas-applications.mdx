Gateway users can now apply granular controls to their file sharing and AI chat applications through [HTTP policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies).

The new feature offers two methods of controlling SaaS applications:

- **Application Controls** are curated groupings of Operations which provide an easy way for users to achieve a specific outcome. Application Controls may include _Upload_, _Download_, _Prompt_, _Voice_, and _Share_ depending on the application.
- **Operations** are controls aligned to the most granular action a user can take. This provides a fine-grained approach to enforcing policy and generally aligns to the SaaS providers API specifications in naming and function.

Get started using [Application Granular Controls](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/granular-controls) and refer to the list of [supported applications](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/http-policies/granular-controls/#compatible-applications).
