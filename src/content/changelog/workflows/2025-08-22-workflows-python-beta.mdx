You can now build [Workflows](/workflows/) using Python. With Python Workflows, you get automatic retries, state persistence, and the ability to run multi-step operations that can span minutes, hours, or weeks using Python’s familiar syntax and the [Python Workers](/workers/languages/python/) runtime. 

Python Workflows use the same step-based execution model as JavaScript Workflows, but with Python syntax and access to Python’s ecosystem. Python Workflows also enable [DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) workflows](/workflows/python/dag/), where you can define complex dependencies between steps using the depends parameter.

Here’s a simple example:

```python
from workers import Response, WorkflowEntrypoint

class PythonWorkflowStarter(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):
        @step.do("my first step")
        async def my_first_step():
            # do some work
            return "Hello Python!"

        await my_first_step()

        await step.sleep("my-sleep-step", "10 seconds")

        @step.do("my second step")
        async def my_second_step():
            # do some more work
            return "Hello again!"

        await my_second_step()

async def on_fetch(request, env):
    await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create()
    return Response("Hello Workflow creation!")
```

:::note
Python Workflows requires a `compatibility_date = "2025-08-01"`, or lower, in your wrangler toml file.
:::

Python Workflows support the same core capabilities as JavaScript Workflows, including sleep scheduling, event-driven workflows, and built-in error handling with configurable retry policies.
