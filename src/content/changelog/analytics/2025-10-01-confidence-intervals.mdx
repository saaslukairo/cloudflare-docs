The GraphQL Analytics API now supports confidence intervals for `sum` and `count` fields on adaptive (sampled) datasets. Confidence intervals provide a statistical range around sampled results, helping verify accuracy and quantify uncertainty. 

- **Supported datasets**: Adaptive (sampled) datasets only.
- **Supported fields**: All `sum` and `count` fields.
- **Usage**: The confidence `level` must be provided as a decimal between 0 and 1 (e.g. `0.90`, `0.95`, `0.99`). 
- **Default**: If no confidence level is specified, no intervals are returned.

For examples and more details, see the [GraphQL Analytics API documentation](/analytics/graphql-api/features/confidence-intervals/).
