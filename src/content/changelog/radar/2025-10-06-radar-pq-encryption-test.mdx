[**Radar**](/radar/) now includes browser detection for Post-quantum (PQ) encryption.
The [Post-quantum encryption card](https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption) now checks whether a user’s browser supports post-quantum encryption.
If support is detected, information about the key agreement in use is displayed.
