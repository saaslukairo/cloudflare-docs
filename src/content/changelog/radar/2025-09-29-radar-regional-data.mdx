[**Radar**](/radar/) now introduces Regional Data, providing traffic insights that bring a more localized perspective to the traffic trends shown on Radar.

The following API endpoints are now available:

- [`Get Geolocation`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/geolocations/methods/get/) - Retrieves geolocation by `geoId`.
- [`List Geolocations`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/geolocations/methods/list/) - Lists geolocations.
- [`NetFlows Summary By Dimension`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/netflows/methods/summary_v2/) - Retrieves NetFlows summary by dimension.

All `summary` and `timeseries_groups` endpoints in [`HTTP`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/) and [`NetFlows`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/netflows/) now include an `adm1` dimension for grouping data by first level administrative division (for example, state, province, etc.)

A new filter `geoId` was also added to all endpoints in [`HTTP`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/) and [`NetFlows`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/netflows/), allowing filtering by a specific administrative division.

Check out the new Regional traffic insights on a country specific traffic page [new Radar page](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/pt).
