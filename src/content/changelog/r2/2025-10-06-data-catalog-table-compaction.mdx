You can now enable compaction for individual [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) tables in [R2 Data Catalog](/r2/data-catalog/), giving you fine-grained control over different workloads.

```bash
# Enable compaction for a specific table (no token required)
npx wrangler r2 bucket catalog compaction enable <BUCKET> <NAMESPACE> <TABLE> --target-size 256
```

This allows you to:

- Apply different target file sizes per table
- Disable compaction for specific tables
- Optimize based on table-specific access patterns
