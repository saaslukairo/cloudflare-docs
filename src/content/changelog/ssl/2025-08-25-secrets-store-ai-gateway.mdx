Cloudflare Secrets Store is now integrated with AI Gateway, allowing you to store, manage, and deploy your AI provider keys in a secure and seamless configuration through [Bring Your Own Key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/). Instead of passing your AI provider keys directly in every request header, you can centrally manage each key with Secrets Store and deploy in your gateway configuration using only a reference, rather than passing the value in plain text.

You can now create a secret directly from your AI Gateway [in the dashboard](http://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai-gateway) by navigating into your gateway -> **Provider Keys** -> **Add**.

You can also create your secret with the newly available **ai_gateway** scope via [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/), the [Secrets Store dashboard](http://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/secrets-store), or the [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/secrets_store/).

Then, pass the key in the request header using its Secrets Store reference:

```
curl -X POST https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<ACCOUNT_ID>/my-gateway/anthropic/v1/messages \
 --header 'cf-aig-authorization: ANTHROPIC_KEY_1 \
 --header 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data  '{"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Cloudflare?"}]}'
 ```

 Or, using Javascript:

 ```
 import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';


const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: "ANTHROPIC_KEY_1",
  baseURL: "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<ACCOUNT_ID>/my-gateway/anthropic",
});


const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
  messages: [{role: "user", content: "What is Cloudflare?"}],
  max_tokens: 1024
});
```
