AI Gateway adds additional ways to handle requests - [Request Timeouts](/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-timeouts) and [Request Retries](/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries), making it easier to keep your applications responsive and reliable.

Timeouts and retries can be used on both the [Universal Endpoint](/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) or directly to a [supported provider](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/).

**Request timeouts**
A [request timeout](/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-timeouts) allows you to trigger [fallbacks](/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/) or a retry if a provider takes too long to respond.

To set a request timeout directly to a provider, add a `cf-aig-request-timeout` header.

```bash title="Provider-specific endpoint example" {4}
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer {cf_api_token}' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --header 'cf-aig-request-timeout: 5000'
 --data '{"prompt": "What is Cloudflare?"}'
```

**Request retries**
A [request retry](/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) automatically retries failed requests, so you can recover from temporary issues without intervening.

To set up request retries directly to a provider, add the following headers:

- cf-aig-max-attempts (number)
- cf-aig-retry-delay (number)
- cf-aig-backoff ("constant" | "linear" | "exponential)
