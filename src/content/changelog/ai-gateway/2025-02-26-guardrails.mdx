[AI Gateway](/ai-gateway/) now includes [Guardrails](/ai-gateway/features/guardrails/), to help you monitor your AI apps for harmful or inappropriate content and deploy safely.

Within the AI Gateway settings, you can configure:

- **Guardrails**: Enable or disable content moderation as needed.
- **Evaluation scope**: Select whether to moderate user prompts, model responses, or both.
- **Hazard categories**: Specify which categories to monitor and determine whether detected inappropriate content should be blocked or flagged.
