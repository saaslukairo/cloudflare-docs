We are excited to announce that [AI Gateway](/ai-gateway/) now supports real-time AI interactions with the new [Realtime WebSockets API](/ai-gateway/usage/websockets-api/realtime-api/).

This new capability allows developers to establish persistent, low-latency connections between their applications and AI models, enabling natural, real-time conversational AI experiences, including speech-to-speech interactions.

The Realtime WebSockets API works with the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime#connect-with-websockets), [Google Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/multimodal-live), and supports real-time text and speech interactions with models from [Cartesia](https://docs.cartesia.ai/api-reference/tts/tts), and [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/conversational-ai/websocket).

Here's how you can connect AI Gateway to [OpenAI's Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime#connect-with-websockets) using WebSockets:

```javascript title="OpenAI Realtime API example"
import WebSocket from "ws";

const url =
	"wss://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway>/openai?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17";
const ws = new WebSocket(url, {
	headers: {
		"cf-aig-authorization": process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY,
		Authorization: "Bearer " + process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
		"OpenAI-Beta": "realtime=v1",
	},
});

ws.on("open", () => console.log("Connected to server."));
ws.on("message", (message) => console.log(JSON.parse(message.toString())));

ws.send(
	JSON.stringify({
		type: "response.create",
		response: { modalities: ["text"], instructions: "Tell me a joke" },
	}),
);
```
