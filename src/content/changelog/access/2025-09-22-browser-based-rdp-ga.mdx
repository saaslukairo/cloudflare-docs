[Browser-based RDP](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/rdp/rdp-browser/) with [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) is now generally available for all Cloudflare customers. It enables secure, remote Windows server access without VPNs or RDP clients.

Since we announced our [open beta](/changelog/access/#2025-06-30), we've made a few improvements:

- Support for targets with IPv6.
- Support for [Magic WAN](/magic-wan/) and [WARP Connector](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/warp-connector/) as on-ramps.
- More robust error messaging on the login page to help you if you encounter an issue.
- Worldwide keyboard support. Whether your day-to-day is in Portuguese, Chinese, or something in between, your browser-based RDP experience will look and feel exactly like you are using a desktop RDP client.
- Cleaned up some other miscellaneous issues, including but not limited to enhanced support for Entra ID accounts and support for usernames with spaces, quotes, and special characters.

As a refresher, here are some benefits browser-based RDP provides:

- **Control how users authenticate to internal RDP resources** with single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and granular access policies.
- **Record who is accessing which servers and when** to support regulatory compliance requirements and to gain greater visibility in the event of a security event.
- **Eliminate the need to install and manage software on user devices**. You will only need a web browser.
- **Reduce your attack surface** by keeping your RDP servers off the public Internet and protecting them from common threats like credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.
