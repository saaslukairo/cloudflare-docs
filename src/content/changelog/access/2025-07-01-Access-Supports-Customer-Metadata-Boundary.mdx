Cloudflare Access logs now support the [Customer Metadata Boundary (CMB)](/data-localization/metadata-boundary/). If you have configured the CMB for your account, all Access logging will respect that configuration. 

:::note
For EU CMB customers, the logs will not be stored by Access and will appear as empty in the dashboard. EU CMB customers should utilize [Logpush](/logs/logpush/) to retain their Access logging, if desired.
