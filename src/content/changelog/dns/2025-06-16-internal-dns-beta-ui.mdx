Participating beta testers can now fully configure [Internal DNS](/dns/internal-dns/) directly in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/internal-dns).

## Internal DNS enables customers to:

- Map internal hostnames to private IPs for services, devices, and applications not exposed to the public Internet

- Resolve internal DNS queries securely through [Cloudflare Gateway](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/)

- Use split-horizon DNS to return different responses based on network context

- Consolidate internal and public DNS zones within a single management platform

## What’s new in this release:

- Beta participants can now create and manage internal zones and views in the Cloudflare dashboard
