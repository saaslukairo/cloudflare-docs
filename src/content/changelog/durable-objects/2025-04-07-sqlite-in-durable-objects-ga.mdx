SQLite in Durable Objects is now generally available (GA) with 10GB SQLite database per Durable Object. Since the [public beta](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sqlite-in-durable-objects/) in September 2024, we've added feature parity and robustness for the SQLite storage backend compared to the preexisting key-value (KV) storage backend for Durable Objects.

SQLite-backed Durable Objects are recommended for all new Durable Object classes, using `new_sqlite_classes` [Wrangler configuration](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#create-sqlite-backed-durable-object-class). Only SQLite-backed Durable Objects have access to Storage API's [SQL](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#sql-api) and [point-in-time recovery](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#pitr-point-in-time-recovery-api) methods, which provide relational data modeling, SQL querying, and better data management.

```js
export class MyDurableObject extends DurableObject {
  sql: SqlStorage
  constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(ctx, env);
    this.sql = ctx.storage.sql;
  }

  async sayHello() {
    let result = this.sql
      .exec("SELECT 'Hello, World!' AS greeting")
      .one();
    return result.greeting;
  }
}
```

KV-backed Durable Objects remain for backwards compatibility, and a migration path from key-value storage to SQL storage for existing Durable Object classes will be offered in the future.
