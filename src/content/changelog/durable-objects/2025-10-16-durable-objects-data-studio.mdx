You can now view and write to each Durable Object's storage using a UI editor on the Cloudflare dashboard. Only Durable Objects using [SQLite storage](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#create-sqlite-backed-durable-object-class) can use Data Studio.  

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/workers/durable-objects" />

Data Studio unlocks easier data access with Durable Objects for prototyping application data models to debugging production storage usage. Before, querying your Durable Objects data required deploying a Worker.

To access a Durable Object, you can provide an object's unique name or ID generated by Cloudflare. Data Studio requires you to have at least the `Workers Platform Admin` role, and all queries are captured with audit logging for your security and compliance needs. Queries executed by Data Studio send requests to your remote, deployed objects and incur normal usage billing.
