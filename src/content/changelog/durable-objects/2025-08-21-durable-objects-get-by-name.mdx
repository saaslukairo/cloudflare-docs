You can now create a client (a [Durable Object stub](/durable-objects/api/stub/)) to a Durable Object with the new `getByName` method, removing the need to convert Durable Object names to IDs and then create a stub.

```js
// Before: (1) translate name to ID then (2) get a client 
const objectId = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.idFromName("foo"); // or .newUniqueId()
const stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(objectId); 

// Now: retrieve client to Durable Object directly via its name 
const stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.getByName("foo");

// Use client to send request to the remote Durable Object
const rpcResponse = await stub.sayHello();
```

Each Durable Object has a globally-unique name, which allows you to send requests to a specific object from anywhere in the world. Thus, a Durable Object can be used to coordinate between multiple clients who need to work together. You can have billions of Durable Objects, providing isolation between application tenants.
