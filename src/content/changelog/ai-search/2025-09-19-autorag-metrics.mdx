[AutoRAG](/ai-search/) now includes a **Metrics** tab that shows how your data is indexed and searched. Get a clear view of the health of your indexing pipeline, compare usage between `ai-search` and `search`, and see which files are retrieved most often.

You can find these metrics within each AutoRAG instance:

- Indexing: Track how files are ingested and see status changes over time.
- Search breakdown: Compare usage between `ai-search` and `search` endpoints.
- Top file retrievals: Identify which files are most frequently retrieved in a given period.
