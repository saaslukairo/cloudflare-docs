[AutoRAG](/ai-search/) is now in open beta, making it easy for you to build fully-managed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines without managing infrastructure. Just upload your docs to [R2](/r2/get-started/), and AutoRAG handles the rest: embeddings, indexing, retrieval, and response generation via API.

With AutoRAG, you can:

- **Customize your pipeline:** Choose from [Workers AI](/workers-ai) models, configure chunking strategies, edit system prompts, and more.
- **Instant setup:** AutoRAG provisions everything you need from [Vectorize](/vectorize), [AI gateway](/ai-gateway), to pipeline logic for you, so you can go from zero to a working RAG pipeline in seconds.
- **Keep your index fresh:** AutoRAG continuously syncs your index with your data source to ensure responses stay accurate and up to date.
- **Ask questions:** Query your data and receive grounded responses via a [Workers binding](/ai-search/usage/workers-binding/) or [API](/ai-search/usage/rest-api/).

Whether you're building internal tools, AI-powered search, or a support assistant, AutoRAG gets you from idea to deployment in minutes.
