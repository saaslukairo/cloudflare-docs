You can now filter [AutoRAG](/ai-search/) search results by `folder` and `timestamp` using [metadata filtering](/ai-search/configuration/metadata) to narrow down the scope of your query.

This makes it easy to build [multitenant experiences](/ai-search/how-to/multitenancy/) where each user can only access their own data. By organizing your content into per-tenant folders and applying a `folder` filter at query time, you ensure that each tenant retrieves only their own documents.

**Example folder structure:**

```bash
customer-a/logs/
customer-a/contracts/
customer-b/contracts/
```

**Example query:**

```js
const response = await env.AI.autorag("my-autorag").search({
	query: "When did I sign my agreement contract?",
	filters: {
		type: "eq",
		key: "folder",
		value: "customer-a/contracts/",
	},
});
```

You can use metadata filtering by creating a new AutoRAG or reindexing existing data. To reindex all content in an existing AutoRAG, update any chunking setting and select **Sync index**. Metadata filtering is available for all data indexed on or after **April 21, 2025**.

If you are new to AutoRAG, get started with the [Get started AutoRAG guide](/ai-search/get-started/).
