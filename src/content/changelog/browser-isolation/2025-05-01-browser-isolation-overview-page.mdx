A new **Browser Isolation Overview** page is now available in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard. This centralized view simplifies the management of [Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)](/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/) deployments, providing:

- **Streamlined Onboarding:** Easily set up and manage isolation policies from one location.
- **Quick Testing:** Validate [clientless web application isolation](/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/) with ease.
- **Simplified Configuration:** Configure [isolated access applications](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/isolate-application/) and policies efficiently.
- **Centralized Monitoring:** Track aggregate usage and blocked actions.

This update consolidates previously disparate settings, accelerating deployment, improving visibility into isolation activity, and making it easier to ensure your protections are working effectively.
