It’s now easy to create **wildcard-based [URL Rewrites](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/)**. No need for complex functions—just define your patterns and go.

What’s improved:

- **Full wildcard support** – Create rewrite patterns using intuitive interface.
- **Simplified rule creation** – No need for complex functions.

Try it via [creating a Rewrite URL rule in the dashboard](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/#wildcard-pattern-parameters).
