Starting February 2, 2026, the `cloudflared proxy-dns` command will be removed from all new `cloudflared` [releases](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/).

This change is being made to enhance security and address a potential vulnerability in an underlying DNS library. This vulnerability is specific to the `proxy-dns` command and does not affect any other `cloudflared` features, such as the core [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) service.

The `proxy-dns` command, which runs a client-side [DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)](/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/) proxy, has been an officially undocumented feature for several years. This functionality is fully and securely supported by our actively developed products.

Versions of `cloudflared` released before this date will not be affected and will continue to operate. However, note that our [official support policy](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/downloads/#deprecated-releases) for any `cloudflared` release is one year from its release date.

## Migration paths

We strongly advise users of this undocumented feature to migrate to one of the following officially supported solutions before February 2, 2026, to continue benefiting from secure [DNS-over-HTTPS](/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/).

### End-user devices

The preferred method for enabling DNS-over-HTTPS on user devices is the [Cloudflare WARP client](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/). The WARP client automatically secures and proxies all DNS traffic from your device, integrating it with your organization's [Zero Trust policies](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/) and [posture checks](/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/posture-checks/).

### Servers, routers, and IoT devices

For scenarios where installing a client on every device is not possible (such as servers, routers, or IoT devices), we recommend using the [WARP Connector](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/warp-connector/).

Instead of running `cloudflared proxy-dns` on a machine, you can install the WARP Connector on a single Linux host within your private network. This connector will act as a gateway, securely routing all DNS and network traffic from your [entire subnet](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/warp-connector/site-to-internet/) to Cloudflare for [filtering and logging](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/).
