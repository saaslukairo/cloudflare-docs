The latest `cloudflared` build [2024.12.2](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/tag/2024.12.2) introduces the ability to collect all the diagnostic logs needed to troubleshoot a `cloudflared` instance.

A diagnostic report collects data from a single instance of `cloudflared` running on the local machine and outputs it to a `cloudflared-diag` file.
