title: Faster, more reliable UDP traffic for Cloudflare Tunnel
description: We've re-architected how Cloudflare Tunnel handles UDP traffic. Your real-time applications are now faster and more stable, especially on Tunnels with mixed TCP and UDP traffic.

Your real-time applications running over [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) are now faster and more reliable. We've completely re-architected the way `cloudflared` proxies UDP traffic in order to isolate it from other traffic, ensuring latency-sensitive applications like private DNS are no longer slowed down by heavy TCP traffic (like file transfers) on the same Tunnel.

This is a foundational improvement to Cloudflare Tunnel, delivered automatically to all customers. There are no settings to configure — your UDP traffic is already flowing faster and more reliably.

**What’s new:**
- **Faster UDP performance**: We've significantly reduced the latency for establishing new UDP sessions, making applications like private DNS much more responsive.
- **Greater reliability for mixed traffic**: UDP packets are no longer affected by heavy TCP traffic, preventing timeouts and connection drops for your real-time services.
